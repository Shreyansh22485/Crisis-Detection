doqwow,2019-10-29 20:22:02,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",depression,2364,177,SQLwitch,understand people reply immediately op invitation talk privately mean help type response usually leads either disappointment disaster usually works quite differently say pm anytime casual social context huge admiration appreciation goodwill good citizenship many support others flag inappropriate content even know many struggling hard work behind scenes information resources make easier give get quality help small start new wiki page explains detail much better respond public comments least youve gotten know someone maintained rdepressionwikiprivate_contact full text current version summary anyone acting helper invites accepts private contact ie pms chat kind offsite communication early conversion showing either bad intentions bad judgement either way unwise trust pm anytime seems like kind generous offer might perfectly wellmeaning unless solid rapport established wise idea points consider offer accept invitation communicate privately posting supportive replies publicly youll help people op responses good quality youll educate inspire helpers rule applies much anywhere else internet people struggling serious mentalhealth issues often justifiably low tolerance disappointment highlevel everchanging emotional need unless helper able make commitment every way long necessary offering personal inbox resource likely harm good mentalhealth crisisline responders usually dont give names callers arent allowed request specific responders much healthier safer callers develop relationship agency whole analogously much safer healthier ops develop relationship community whole even trained responders generally allowed work highintensity situations alone partly availability mostly wider perspective preventing compassion fatigue helper gets head someone whose mentalhealth issues including suicidality often comorbid depression escalate pm conversation much harder others including rdepression rsuicidewatch moderators help contrary common assumptions moderators cant see police pms observation many years people say pm consistently ones least understanding mentalhealth issues mentalhealth support gaps knowledge ability communicate effectively community input mitigates limitations theres reason someone whos truly help would want hide responses community scrutiny helpers concerned privacy keep mind selfdisclosure used supportively feelings details problem use altthrowaway accounts restrictions account age karma know internet used people exploit abuse others people want hide deceptive manipulative responses everyone except victims many specifically target vulnerable mentalhealth issues helper invites op talk privately gives good supportive experience theyve primed person vulnerable abusers sort cognitive priming tends particularly effective someones state mentalhealth crisis people rely heuristics critical reasoning ops want talk privately posting wideopen anonymous forum like reddit might best option although dont recommend allow ops request private contact asking support want please keep expectations realistic careful look history anyone offers pm opening
1frqlk0,2024-09-29 04:35:43,"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",depression,29,247,SQLwitch,welcome rdepressions checkin post place take moment share going accomplishment want talk shouldnt standalone posts sub violate role model rule permitted tough time prefer make post place share subreddit rules located sidebar also always access since exist important safety reasons ask everyone read follow please click report harmful content see always want know deal soon also several wikis help finding giving support provides guidance isnt depressive disorder guidance complex nature illnesses usually grouped depression label redirect information common offtopic issues offers information nature value peer support mentalhealth issues general lots guidance learning isnt usually helpful giving peer support ysk types rule violations frequently see interfering people getting safe relevant support people breaking private contact rule never trust anyone tries get private conversation response post see im help posts shows dont understand basic principles peer support especially selectivity giving help wiki explains role modelling ie achievement advice posts expertfree zone thats peer support means rule know internet culture celebrate bragging achievements bragging good intentions nothing like ever acceptable content thats making statement casually polling sub seeking personal support comment giving rules offtopic posts difficult situations circumstances including interpersonal losses grief sadness anger difficult emotions mental illnesses depression wiki suggestions places post issues valid serious inappropriate

No skills or finances to go to try and get an education. My mother recently died a long painful death. I’m struggling horribly with the bereavement and with having to really be an adult for the first time. 
I don’t have The balls to tackle my addiction, I have a girlfriend who is supportive in a lot of ways but I know she’s looking for a way out of the relationship. And I don’t blame her. I can’t stop myself from fucking my life up worse… 

my partner who is legitimately my only living person who I think is close to me. Doesn’t open up, is probably so sick of dealing with my shit that she doesn’t really seem to be bothered about my mental health anymore and seems to take any chance possible to not spend time with me. Infidelity on her part has been on the cards multiple times and I know it’s only a matter of time before I push her into it if I haven’t already. (Strongly believe she has but of course she doesn’t trust me enough to be open about this sort of thing.)

As of right now she’s more or less the only thing I care about or have in life anymore and I’m really starting to believe that she can’t be happy with me and I can’t be happy without her.

What should I get in order to make sure that she does manage to end up happy? Would just breaking up with her make it seem like all the effort she did put in was pointless? Being in the mindset that she’s more or less over me, would a decent life insurance policy and just taking myself to a place with less pain really hurt her if it was enough for her to be set and find someone that actually makes her happy? 

And incase maybe I haven’t made it clear, I do treasure this woman but on multiple times she’s made it clear that this feelings are not reciprocated. That’s on me, I can’t imagine anyone would actually manage to be happy with me being a major part of their life.

I really need someone to talk to :( I hate my life right now. Everything was meant to be going great but it doesn’t feel like that.
I just graduated uni, got accepted to what would be my dream job and I feel like I should be happy and thankful for what I have but honestly, I feel miserable. I’ve been at this job for 4 weeks (in a grad position) and of course I’ve been given the absolute worst tasks ever that no one wants to do with very little guidance. Like email over 100 people. Separately. Because bcc is “frowned upon.” I literally spend 9-5 staring at a computer screen. Everyone in my office is besties and they definitely haven’t tried to make me feel included or welcome. I just sit there by myself typing all day. No one will have lunch with me. No one will chat to be during the day unless they want something done. I know I need to make more of an effort but it’s so hard when I feel like I’m waking on eggshells. 

And my commute is god awful to make things better. When I get home I’m so tired and feel miserable. I’m so stuck in my head. My partner and I are fine but we never or should I say rarely ever do anything besides watch movies together. I feel disconnected from everything. 

I’ve lost all my friends since graduation and my family and I don’t speak. (They abused me as a child.) I feel so alone. No one to talk to. I have a therapist but she sucks. I’ve also been struggling so bad with my anxiety to the where I’ve been myself sick. I hate this life. I don’t want to live this way but I don’t know what to do.

1j8mbr6,2025-03-11 14:20:40,I don't know who I am anymore,"I feel like the last six years passed by in the blink of an eye. Something inside me broke and I can't even tell what it is. 

It all started when I left my family house permanently to go to a boarding school in a different city. It was a great opportunity at the time, but I clearly was not ready for such a sudden change at 14 yo. When I first started the boarding school, I had a lot of confidence in myself, I was happy and accepting of the people around me. By the end of the second week, I had already set up my friend group. I was under the impression that this place would be my home now, warm and filled with people I can grow up with. 

But I had a secret that would run everything upside down. I was a homosexual. Even though I had not told anyone about it, people could already see through the facade I was putting and they were gossiping about it. I felt personally backstabbed when I heard that my best friend and roommate at the time told someone else that I would sell myself for pennies. I was at a loss for words, very scared, and regretful of being so credulous. But for some reason, that was not the worst part. I was pondering what my parents would think if they found out who I actually was. Would they hate me or feel sorry for me, think they raised a snake in their bosom or just someone born unlucky? I must have decided on the former because I made up my mind to change completely. How I spoke, to whom I spoke, what I did daily... The first year of high school after that moment was spent mostly on my bed. I gave up on my lifelong interests of playing the piano, practicing tennis, and reading. In classes I held back and avoided interactions with others. I numbed myself watching YouTube videos and movies. Going to cafeteria become a pain. My faith in God was irreversibly severed. I cried so much I can't cry anymore. 

After that school year ended and I got back to my hometown, I tried to get back to tennis. My friends at the tennis club used to mean the world to me, we used to go to tennis tournaments together around the country and had many adventures and when they ignored me for god knows why, I knew I didn't have a single friend left in this world. Clearly, my friends had grown during their first year of high school, whereas I had grown more worthless. The second year, I transferred to a different dorm room. I was making friends because I was decent-looking and more cautious. But, I fear I never meant anything to anyone. I was not memorable. Was not special. When you are lonely and don't have anything special going in your life, no one really appreciates you anymore, you turn into a walking red flag. I guess that's what happened to me. COVID interrupted high school, and I went back home. I was grateful to be given a 2 weeks break from the dorm but when that time was extended to 1.5 years, it complicated things. I barely spoke with anyone my age in 1.5 years. I slowly grew detached, tried to get back to tennis but failed.   
  
End of COVID, classes begin again in 11th grade. I go to the school, surrounded by people I barely know. I grew taller and skinnier during COVID, and I looked uglier. I was invisible. I studied extremely hard because I did not know what else to do. I tried to join organizations but ended up getting rejected from all of them. College applications were closing in and I was studying with all I had. At this point, my life was a mess, and I felt it but didn't want to accept it. I challenged myself as much as I could, hoping it would save me. Took the most difficult college-level classes and tried to do good at them. That's who I was. Good student. Not smart but ambitious as my physics teacher used to say.   


In the last year of high school, with all the stress of coursework and college applications, I was blinded by what life was and wasn't. Then, there was the girl. The only girl I ever imagined myself with until then. She had dreamy eyes, was high on life, and she was loved by all but seemed to be going through a rough patch herself. I was invisible, but she saw me anyway. I taught her how to play tennis, listened to her play the piano intoxicated, we laid on her bed together, we walked down the streets hand to hand, and even though she meant the world to me, I didn't love her. No matter how much I tried, wanted to. High school ended and everyone parted ways. 

College begins, and I fly to the US, like a skipping stone I move farther away from home. As wasted and numb as I might be, I came to college with a mission to fix myself. That meant doing everything differently than I did in high school. My first day in the US I remember going to a football match, jumping around with fellow students. Then, I made friends with my roommates and rushed a fraternity with them. My roommates were like my two little brothers, I really loved them, I would come to the dorm from class after a long day and chat with them about all kinds of things. Unfortunately, I got sucked into this drinking/partying culture due to their influence. When I started drinking, I made sure to get wasted because it took all the pain away. I drank at every opportunity, made the first moves on all girls to put on a strong facade. Deep down, I believe I hoped to find the one girl who could save me, but no matter how many girls I made out with, I was never turned on. The year ended and I went back home. 

My sophomore year, all my friends moved to the frat house and I got an apartment 20 minutes away. I made a pact to myself, this would be the year I fixed myself. I took the maximum number of credits and worked a job, while actively searching for an internship...

1j8k157,2025-03-11 11:25:18,I'm losing my shit. cant take it anymore,"I completely lost this shit. I suck at everything and no one's 1st choice. People don't care about me, and there are times that I haven't opened my mouth in weeks and had conversations with anybody, even though I wished I had conversations irl. Nobody has me, and I have no one. Everyone seems much happier without me anyway, smarter, having skills, having fun with others, and making memories. I can't, and I don't deserve and be allowed to be. I wish things were much more different. I don't even feel alone and lonely anymore, because it's already too much of that, I'm just losing it now.

Now, I'm expected to be an adult, when I don't even fucking feel like it. And thanks to this pandemic. Every fucking day I try going out, not on social media, and shit doesn't work. I feel lost and I regret everything. Every day I feel hopeless, and I'm already out of time. Just gotta do this shit for the next 65 years, and that's if I even would reach my 20s at this point. Fuck everything. And fuck porn and only fans models for making things worse by appearing on my feed, even though I don't watch it. they can go fuck themselves.

And when people say, just be happy, or ""there's always someone worse"", it ain't doing shit. I've lost it. At least every day you don't fucking regret the past, feel hopeless every day, wish you had a different life, want to die, and don't have people or anyone to talk to. Im even too old to do stupid stuff and expect to grow up. I can't anymore. People can see all my mistakes but don't see my pain. Im just gonna rot and die and be forgotten anyway, there's much better people out there anyway and I don't deserve to hang out and have fun, and when I do it's wrong and childish.

I never share my actual feelings. They all think im confident and happy, but i struggle. I dont want to burden them. i have to be the strong one, for myself and others.

and caring for people makes me a little happy. Im glad i can help people through tough times, but then again…when does someone check up on me?

i know it sounds selfish, but i just want to know someone cares as much as i do for them, and wont only care once im gone.

ive had my personal experiences that have lead to my feelings of worthlessness and loneliness. But im so lucky to have the life i do…that i again feel bad for even making this post complaining about my life.

1j8mqqw,2025-03-11 14:52:47,My Life Is Out of Control,"I’m not a lazy person, but I find it incredibly hard to push myself to work and do something significant. My entire conscious life, I have been completely dependent on my family, who provided for my education and everything else. I never really had a childhood—no socializing with other kids, no freedom—just endless studying and activities I hated, which drained every part of me.

I was always burdened with extreme responsibility, so I never experienced my teenage years the way I should have. My life felt like an endless hell of suffering, and it seemed like it would never end.

Then, someone came into my life. Someone who had almost nothing but still pulled me out of that hell—at the cost of their own health and personal life. They took me under their wing, helped me in every possible way. But in the end, we both ended up trapped. We had an agreement: in return for all this help, we would work together on a major project.

But I kept resisting. I was so exhausted from working like crazy and being torn between two extremes: staying in the familiar pain or stepping into something new, knowing there would be no turning back. And now, for over a year, we haven’t been actively working on anything. I haven’t brought in a single cent or a single client—though I’ve created incredible designs, marketing materials, and more.

My resistance comes from my fear of independence, my fear of taking responsibility for myself. I have no addictions, except for one—I endlessly eat and waste my energy on meaningless social interactions. No one knows what I’m really going through. I realize that I’m behaving like a parasite, like a child who refuses to grow up. But after years of endless suffering, moving toward success and independence feels unbearably painful.

You get so used to the violence, to the struggle, that the mere idea of another life doesn’t just seem impossible—it feels unbearable.

I don’t know what to do. I have a deadline in two days, and I have nothing to show for it. I feel like I’m making the biggest mistake of my life, and I don’t know how to recover. Please, help me.

1j8ivb0,2025-03-11 10:08:44,My sad life and cycle of one side conversation.,"I’m just a Brazilian guy, and I’ve always been a lonely person without friends or family. I've met many people in my life, but friendships never seemed to work out. Eventually, I started trying to connect with people who were depressed or going through problems, thinking that maybe we could understand each other. But that only ended up making me feel worse. Most people who are lonely and don’t have anyone to talk to or spend time with are in a constant state of longing for something they can’t quite express. I don’t know what they are looking for, but they often ignore me and forget about my existence once they get what they need. It feels like a one-sided relationship where I care for them, but they don’t seem to care back.

When I finally meet someone who doesn’t just have a one-sided conversation, things seem to go well. But once they get better and move on from their depression and loneliness, they don’t want to communicate with me anymore. I feel like, when they were at their lowest, what connected us was the fact that I was there when nobody else was. But when they improve, I’m just someone to throw away.

Do people dislike me because I’m very communicative, while they are not? I don’t understand. It’s not like I’m constantly sharing negative things about my life or anything like that. They just stop responding—either they block me or send hurtful words.

I feel like I’ve wasted days, hours, and years of my life helping others, being genuine, and caring for them. In the end, I’m always the one left without friends. On my birthday, there’s nobody to talk to. My phone contacts are empty, and the only notifications I get are from my phone company asking me to recharge credits, or spam messages. Not even scammers send me messages anymore. It’s like I don’t even exist to anyone. Years will pass, and I’ll just get older, with the only friend I have being myself. People say that you need to love yourself... but for what purpose? Life feels empty when you have no one to share anything with. Even if you meet people, they either reply to your messages with indifference or ignore what you’re writing or saying. It’s always one-sided. All you do is work, work, and then go home, watch things, do some empty hobbies, and then go to bed, sleep, and repeat. It’s like the song *Everyday Is Exactly the Same* because I’m stuck in this routine.

I wish I could meet a woman or have a relationship, but how can I do that if nobody likes my existence? No matter what good things I do, or how hard I try, it’s never enough for people. They prefer those who treat them badly over being with me. I don’t know… I just feel overwhelmed. Also, I hate when people write to you when you're feeling bad, saying “if you need someone to talk to, I'm here for you,” but when you actually try to talk with them and want to build some kind of friendship, they just ignore you.

1j8ly90,2025-03-11 13:50:05,Wasting months of vacation/free time completely isolating myself. Has this happened to anyone else?,"hi guys, the truth is I feel very disappointed in myself because I had three months of summer vacation, and due to an irrational anxiety caused by having to study during that period (I did poorly on some finals, however, during my free time I still didn’t manage to study anything, I just spent these last few months feeling anxious and insecure and procrastinating), I started to 'punish' myself by isolating myself from everyone. I stopped responding to messages from friends, and during these three free months, I haven’t gone out with any of them. 


I feel absolutely miserable, especially because I’m twenty years old and now I have to go back to studying and probably getting a job -I'm thinking a temporary one and after a short time probably I'll be quitting, but still feeling unnerved about it-, and that will very likely play a role in making it harder to coordinate plans with friends, even though now I do want to fix my situation—still, I don’t know how to explain to my friends why I’ve been ignoring them for months. 
I’m afraid that at this point they might no longer see me as a friend or that they’ll think negatively of me because of my distant and strange behavior. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to recover from this because it’s utterly absurd. I know my social anxiety and extreme self-insecurity in these recent times have gotten completely out of hand and I can't help but feel like I wasted time that was gold especially at this age...

tell me, has something like this ever happened to you? What would you do in this kind of situation?

1j8jyd2,2025-03-11 11:19:41,Feeling lost,"Hi.

I will just give basic overview of my situation.

Dad killed himself when I was young.

Got into drugs and music.

Music is my passion.


Had a son at 22 with older woman who was abusive to me and our son.


Went to rehab at 33 and rebuilt my life and had son live with me.


Son went back to his mum and she abused him again, I went back to hometown so he could live with me and finish school.

While there I met a co worker and we fell in love.


She died of alcoholism two years ago.

Now my son is facing serious charges and my health is bad again.

I've moved away again to get healthy.


I'm 45 and so worn out by life. I have these physical health issues now and brain lesions that make me wanna die when I think about my future being a steady decline.

I know I'm really depressed, even though I'm being healthy and sober I'm really just struggling with being in my body and brain and existing lately. I'm grieving for when I was strong and healthy. I'm just sad about losing my partner and now my son struggling so much with these charges. I just keep trying to manage but it's so hard.

If I just sit and meditate I can get into an ok space. But I still feel so alone and I struggle to find people who understands or care. I want intimacy but I'm scared of it. I'm just lost in my life. I feel like I'm 80 not 45.

I'm just hoping it will get better.

1j8jox0,2025-03-11 11:01:08,Ex got with someone else and I didn't expect it to hurt this much. Depression is now back in full swing,"I (20) was seeing a girl (21) when she had visited my country as an international student last year. We clicked very quickly and it was the most amazing and fulfilling relationship. It lasted for about 6 months
 However, towards the end of the year, she had to return to her home country across the world, and gave me an ultimatum of doing long distance (for God knows how long... 2 years at least, until we had both finished our degrees and had enough money to fly over to each other) or ending the relationship there. I chose to end the relationship. It seemed like such a monumental task to do long distance for so long. It obviously hurt her but we stayed in contact and remained good friends. Fast forward 4-5 months to last week, after a period of a not talking for a few weeks she reached out and told me she was seeing someone else, and that this person was of the same gender as her, and that she is now identifying as queer. I am happy she has found someone who makes her happy, and it honestly brings a tear to my eye to see her smile and she deserves a mountain of happiness. I just didn't think about what I lost a few months ago when I said no to her - and now it's collapsing onto me like a pile of bricks. I don't want to text her and tell her how I feel, because it's inappropriate, and I'm just forced to wallow in my grief. I woke up this morning and she had removed me on all social media despite her saying she wished to continue talking as friends the night before.

I feel as though my depression is back in full swing and has been for the last week or so. I've dropped pretty much everything and I'm back to being restless at night and wishing I made different life choices. Sometimes it feels like she was the only person who actually cared about me, or maybe I'm just looking through rose tinted glasses. Either way, I'm a complete mess and I feel as though my thoughts about ending my own life are slowly returning.

1j8ffuo,2025-03-11 07:05:02,I don't feel like I exist,"I guess to start off, I don't really know what this is or what I'm doing, but I feel like I need to talk about myself to someone, anyone. I don't know I anyone is interested in reading people's depressing life stories, but I just felt like I had to put something out there in the world, even if no one will read it. 
I'm apparently turning 22 this year. I have no friends, no positive or meaningful relationships with anyone including family, and I don't really feel like I exist anymore. As a kid up to the age of 12 I was physically and emotionally abused and neglected. From the time I was born til pretty much now still I have constantly moved from place to place to place, from school to school. The longest amount of time I've ever really been anywhere was for about 3 years max. Naturally those things mixed together with an already shy kid makes it hard to make friends and socially develop. I've had very few ""friends"" in my life, more like short term acquaintances rather than anything really meaningful. I've experienced an endless list of trauma since I was a kid, including but not limited to finding my stepfather dead after he committed suicide at 10, dealing with a mother who was emotionally and physically neglectful who had a drinking problem and has attempted suicide in front of me, and while many people wouldn't consider moving as a trauma, never having a true home or security or a stable place to even attempt to make friends has been prevalent my entire life. I've never dated or been in a romantic relationship. As someone who is closeted, it's already hard enough to be able to date and have friends that you can relate to. The only physical touch or intimacy I've ever really had in life was meeting grown men 2-3 times my age online for sex, whiched started a long time before I became legal age. Over the years I've accumulated multiple diagnoses: depression, generalized anxiety, DPDR, social anxiety, body dysmorphia, PTSD, panic disorder, etc. I never really got to be a kid or teenager. Throughout that time I'd always tell myself ""when I'm (age) things will be better"" and everytime I'd reach that point it had only gotten worse. 13, 15, 16, 18, 21. Now I'm apparently 22. For the last 2 years I've been sitting in my apartment doing online college ndwoking a couple overnight shifts a week at a gas station. I can't go out because I don't have a license and can't drive, and my body dysmorphia and social anxiety is so bad I can't even work the day shift. I dont know if anyone who's reading this has ever experienced DPDR (derealization/Depersonalization) but my existence has been a constant state of derealization and dissociation since the age of 14. Up until a few months ago it was mostly just the derealization, but now it's severe Depersonalization as well, which basically feels like everyday i wake up and I have someone else's memories and I have to be okay with not really being a person. My anxiety and panic used to be so severe, but now my body and mind are just so tired and worn down that all I feel is constant existential dread. I've completely dissociated my entire teen years and now I'm supposedly in my twenties somehow and I don't understand. Something I did or saw a couple months ago was actually 3 years ago. The last few months I've had this realization I guess you could call it of my on mortality, that at basically any point I could die and there would have been no point to it all. I don't know what's worse, dying now having lived this miserable existence without ever truly living, or dying having done the same things for so much longer. I have so many issues, but I feel like s many of them could have been ""fixed"" by such simple things like having a best friend or anyone that really cared about me to be there, but I'll never have that. I feel like I'm already dead, but I'm still terrified of the concept of death. I don't really know why I wrote all of this. It's not like anyone can change the past or fix my current situation.

In therapy ive acknowledged that rn im incredibly unkind to myself and the focus so far has been on childhood and how that has warped my mind now but nothing feels any different at all.

My current situation is im partially bedbound because every day i wake up from unrefreshed sleep exhausted and in agony to the point now that it seems impossible to overcome. Yeah, i do have disabilities, but i know they arent limiting me to this point, its my overwhelming bad MH. I see others with EDS, diabetes, asthma, fibro and bad MH still have jobs, social lives etc and I just dont understand how.

Through a combo of self isolation and being flaky due to physical pain I have no deep connections with any friend anymore... 

I used to be sporty, i used to be popular/a social butterfly, I got my dream job of a genetic scientist... I really had it all and now im obese, lost my job due to ill health, and I just sleep as much as I can. No exercise anymore, no socialising, no improving myself, no cooking meals, barely bathing, and I havent worn make up in over a year now.

I've worked a physically taxing job for 3 years now that takes up 50 hours per week. I still live at home with my family. I struggle to develop hobbies or go out on my own. I can't seem to find friends or even more so when I do, keep them. I feel like my creativity has died and I can't revive it. All my energy is spent on work I hate and on trying to keep myself together mentally.

I know everyone's journey is there own and goes at it's own pace, but it's hard not to note something wrong when it seems most people my age and younger me have no trouble going out to a bar on their own and making friends/flirting, committing their time and efforts towards passions all while taking on responsibilities such as living on their own and creating careers and skills for themselves. When I was younger I imagined myself at this age having at least made it to the next steps of feeling fulfilled in a unique, individualistic and passionate lifestyle like I'd watched others online do growing up. I wanted to be like that, but it seems I never really did take the steps either cause I'm lazy or busy.  
And now it feels too late to start from ground zero, like life can't be turned around cause I'm not in this next wave of influence or creativity. I've done this to myself, and do I deserve it? I don't want to grow up and become the adult who regrets not becoming a star when they were young. I'm finding it harder to get up everyday and deal with myself and my life.

I don't understand how someone could be happy or at least feel ok most of the time. This is all I've known for a long time. And in my family, I can't think of a single person besides my sister that presents being ok. My dad, my mom, my grandmother, my grandfather, my uncle, my aunt. All of them seem eternally depressed and stressed. How am I even supposed to have a go in life? I'm completely able bodied, there are no major difficulties in my life, but I don't know if it's supposed to be this way.

  
There's no reason for me to continue existing for myself, every reason I think of relates to someone else not feeling bad. It's to a point I don't even care to try to do something about it, there even isn't a chance for me to end it all because it's too hard. Some people seem to enjoy living, I'd like to feel like that one day, it's my dream. It feels awful to acknowledge that that's just how life is for me, and I'll wake up tomorrow, maybe feel slightly better and be hopeful for the future, and someday after that it'll turn back to bad or ok in a never ending cycle.

I have a poor recollection of my memory from the past but i remember my mum finding out and she said a key sentence to me. 

“what reason do you have to be depressed”. 

Now look, im a privileged kid and i get alot and ive had a really good childhood. I have no reason to be depressed or suicidal. I dont know why i did it. Recently ive had a long episode of being in this really weird state. Its been months long and started since i dont know when, Im addicted to the past and how my lifes spiralling out of control. Its not even bad but its like it’s overwhelming and just stimulating me too much. Its like im autistic and all of just, life, is too much for me and gets me overwhelmed. I dont want to kill myself because nobody would care, i dont want to live because nobody would care. 

I dont even fucking know. I cant seem to understand my own feelings and this probably makes fuckall sense but damn am i depressed. I dont know why, i dont know why im just down so much. I cant get girls anymore, i get picked on when i used to be the cool popular person, im just a fucking loser when last year i was ontop of the world and i took it all for fucking granted. Im so selfish and ignorant. Im not fishing for some suckup “aw itll all workout” because itll only get worse from here. I just hate myself in a way and i just want to be loved. I AM loved and i know that but i mean intimately loved. Like i want to be hugged by a girl. I just want a real friend i can talk to. I just want to be loved man. 

Recently, i have a nephew (4M) and his dad (my brother, 29M) and mother (20+F) split up a while back. To cut a long story short shes involved with gangs, drugs and horrible living conditions not fit for my nephew. He was living with us for a while but needed to go to school. We sent him to my primary school. We put regulations in place so he could stay safe. He get taken by his mum and we dont know where he is and we havent seen him since. Im only a kid and i dont get told enough and i really worry. Thats something that gets me down and i have nobody to talk to about it. I was speaking to a girl 2 weeks ago too. Really sweet really nice girl. We planned to meet up again but after we went back to school after the holidays shes been really dry and not messaging. We were supposed to meet at her place last weekend but she cancelled and shes about to cancel this weekend too. I have nobody. My dad wont speak to me. I have nobody real friends and my mum wouldnt litsen or help. I just want to be loved.

1j8i5mh,2025-03-11 09:26:47,I’m depressed but I love my life,"I’ve had my dog since I was 17. Now 28. I feel joy when I watch her fetch a ball and anticipate the next one, sniff some unfamiliar scents on our walk, sleep when she’s out of energy and then start again. Pure joy, right? She’s the only reason I’m here.  

 Depressed people arent supposed to feel joy. That what we all hear, right? Just stale, cardboard human being. Must mean I’m not depressed. Just normal…right?????   

I fantasize about a car on the wrong side of the highway and ending me in an instant. I won’t kill myself though. I do look forward to my dogs next sniff walk. Her next ball chase. Her next huffy recovery from a good run. 

I love flowers, my favorite hobby. One I participate in daily. Liquidambar styraciflua. What a silly, complex name I took the time to learn even though I want to be run over by a car on the highway. 

I was always told that depression meant apathy, not caring about anything. I was told by people who never got to know me that I’m not depressed, even though I’ve felt this way my whole life.

 I’m beginning to think depression is subjective. From day 1 I was subject to the worst of circumstances, so my brain adapted to them. I’m
used to the worst things one can imagine so of course I find joy in dog huffs and the names of plants. I can see and appreciate the value of a joyful dog and a beautiful spring ephemeral. I can feed myself a sandwich and clean my bathroom. 

But I still fantasize about the car on the highway at the “wrong” time. Pray for it to happen. Turn me back into carbons, I don’t wanna be here.  I’m not suicidal, which is a common misconception. 

I don’t think I’d ever kill myself.  I hope for a tragic accident, purely on the receiving end, though. I don’t want to do the doing. I’m somewhere in the unknown. I never had any plan to end my life but I have no attachment to being alive. My depression was never validated because I love my dog and I love flowers and I love their names. 

 I find joy still in the little things, but I just appreciate them for what they are- here for anyone, everyone, not for me.

Now I'm older, I realize that I'm not as mature as I thought, yet I know that, which makes me self-aware.

But...with this course, I can't seem to do it! I delay delay delay.

I realized it is due to the fear of failure but it almost has me in freeze mode.

Case in point...I have an assignment. It isn't really due until the end of the course (August) but I just can't seem to do it. It is almost like I've forgotten how to do assignments! 

I distract myself in so many ways and I can't seem to sit down and do the work. When I do try, my thoughts go straight to the negative.

I know once I finish the course, it will be over with. You would think that would be motivation enough, but sadly, it isn't.

I put on nearly 20 kilos last year. Some of it was finding the right meds but mostly it was me not giving a shit about what I ate. I didn’t want to be around anymore so it was hard to think about my future and how I would feel later on. My university degree becomes harder and harder with each semester and I just feel that fog in my brain that makes it next to impossible to achieve anything. I feel like no one takes it seriously because I seem so happy on the outside.

I genuinely just feel hopeless so often that I just don’t know how to motivate myself.

1j8djis,2025-03-11 05:32:57,I don’t love myself and I feel alone. Is this depression?,"Never posted on reddit before and never in my wildest imagination would I have thought my first post would be on the r/depression thread. But here it goes…

My whole life I have struggled with self-confidence and my whole life I’ve never understood why. I am successful at anything I have put my mind towards even with some pretty tough obstacles that have tried preventing me from succeeding . Up until recently, I was always pretty happy and never had any dark days, but the dark days are becoming more and more plentiful. 

I am 22(M) and I have never been in relationship. But from an outside perspective, I have no reason to be unhappy. I am in shape, I have the best family in the world, I have great friends who care about me deeply, and I am about to graduate from a great college and already have a fantastic job lined up. But I feel something eating at me everyday, telling me I’m not enough or I should be better or I don’t deserve any of the things I have. And the more I get, the stronger those feelings become. 

If you were to ask anyone close to me they would assume I am happy and they would have no idea that I have these feelings and thoughts. And it is becoming harder to hide them. I try to keep myself as busy as possible to avoid having these thoughts and feelings but they are finding me in every situation or anything I do at this point. I feel like I should talk to someone and let them know. But I do not want to burden anyone I love with this so I will probably continue to keep it to myself. The only analogy I can think of to describe my situation is the sad clown or the situation of Robin Williams(may he RIP), one of my favorite actors of all time.

I am currently writing this at my therapy session (AKA the gym) and I am already starting to feel better, but l will post it anyways just in case there is one person that can relate or this helps make one person feel better today.

I moved back with my family last August, not knowing how it would end up. Problems started to arise when they could no longer hide their contempt and resentment of me being a failure and how they were ""ashamed"" of me. My parents have always been very tough and uncaring but this was a different level. When problems started to pile I could almost hear them kicking me out of our home. At one point my mom hid from me an invitation to my brother's engagement party because she didn't want me there as she's too ashamed of me. After a few months they told me it's time to be on my own and leave them be. Literally every fucking day for the past 5 years I spent working to make myself a better human and to feel like I earned their approval. All for nothing.

1.5yr ago, I tried to befriend my coworker who offered to be flatmates and I agreed, just trying to make a friend. Several months later, he completely betrayed me. He snitched on me to our manager that I was applying to different teams and it got me fired. He singlehandedly destroyed years of hard work, setting off a chain of disasters.

I had a long distance relationship with a girl that I really loved with every piece of my heart. At the end of everything, she dumped me, threw me in the trash, and was so ruthlessly cold with me. She even implied she regretted being with me and was low-key flaunting her new, better option. It happened at the same time my parents kicked me out.

I know that my family are perfectly capable of providing love and support. I know that friend is genuinely good with his other friends. And my ex likely loves a new guy too deeply. Everyone to whom I was disposable chose to throw me away and give their love and attention to someone else, and obviously I have to contend that I'm the common problem here. For the past many years I've deprived myself from every act of joy to be successful and worthy, for absolutely nothing. I isolated myself trying to get my degrees and elevate myself professionally and now I'm just too lonely without the approval I had worked for. I spend all my days in silence. Last week I almost begged my family and my ex to talk to me, knowing that I'm dead to them now. Didn't even get a congratulations on my new job. They didn't care that I was moving countries. No one just wanted to see me or talk to me. I feel so abandoned and idk whats the point of even trying anymore. If I die this second, no one will fucking care.

1j83ci7,2025-03-10 22:24:47,Feeling suffocated and trapped in my own life.,"

I'm at my breaking point, Reddit. Life is so unfair sometimes. I always feel left out, everywhere, even in my own family, just because I'm a girl. It's like they're biased against me, and they don't even care.

I've faced so many difficulties in life, but I'm not here to complain. I'm just done. I'm done with being held back, done with being told what I can and can't do, done with being body-shamed and belittled.

I want to be a fashion model, but my parents would never accept it. They want me to prepare for a government job, but I'm not even 1% interested. I've tried to discuss other options with them, like doing an MBA or preparing for CAT, but they're not even willing to listen.

It's like they don't care about my dreams or aspirations. They just want me to conform to their expectations, no matter how toxic or suffocating that is.

I've asked them to send me to a PG, just so I can get out of this house and focus on my studies, but they're not even willing to consider it. I feel like I'm losing my motivation, my confidence, and my sense of self-worth.

To make things worse, we're not a rich family, just a middle-class family struggling to make ends meet. And my mother has severe health issues, which adds to the stress and pressure.

I'm feeling so overwhelmed and depressed right now. My career is fucked up, and I don't even know where to start. I'm scared to take the wrong steps, but I'm also scared to stay stuck in this toxic environment.

But the worst part is, I don't even have the courage to leave my house and start a new life. I'm emotional about my parents, and I know they're not all bad. They've faced difficulties in their life too, and they want me to achieve something to make them proud.

But at what cost? I'm suffocating under their expectations, and I don't know how to escape. I feel like I'm living two lives - one that my parents want me to live, and one that I actually want to live.


TL;DR - Feeling suffocated and trapped in my own life. Parents are biased and toxic, won't let me pursue my dreams, and are holding me back. I'm losing my motivation and confidence, and I don't have the courage to leave my house and start a new life. We're a middle-class family with financial struggles and my mom has severe health issues.",depression,3,1,yeahokbroo,im breaking point reddit life unfair sometimes always feel left everywhere even family im girl like theyre biased dont even care ive faced many difficulties life im complain im done im done held back done told cant done bodyshamed belittled want fashion model parents would never accept want prepare government job im even interested ive tried discuss options like mba preparing cat theyre even willing listen like dont care dreams aspirations want conform expectations matter toxic suffocating ive asked send pg get house focus studies theyre even willing consider feel like im losing motivation confidence sense selfworth make things worse rich family middleclass family struggling make ends meet mother severe health issues adds stress pressure im feeling overwhelmed depressed right career fucked dont even know start im scared take wrong steps im also scared stay stuck toxic environment worst part dont even courage leave house start new life im emotional parents know theyre bad theyve faced difficulties life want achieve something make proud cost im suffocating expectations dont know escape feel like im living two lives one parents want live one actually want live tldr feeling suffocated trapped life parents biased toxic wont let pursue dreams holding back im losing motivation confidence dont courage leave house start new life middleclass family financial struggles mom severe health issues

1j7z5mj,2025-03-10 19:25:17,I can´t remeber what its like to be happy,"I don´t know where to start. I just feel like i need a place to rant. I have been thinking a lot about this lately, i just dont remeber being happy. It sounds weird when I say it. It sounds wrong.

I have only now realized that I no longer know what joy and happines is

It's strange

I feel stupid

But it's unfortunately true

  


I can't remember the last time I felt that way

Sometimes I can feel happiness but it's not joy

It´s stupid

I feel like I'm lying every time I'm with family and friends

It's not fair to them

But I can't remember what it was

That feeling is just empty

No thoughts

No memories

I don't understand why

It's just gone

I don't know what makes me happy anymore

What makes me smile

How such a genuine feeling should feel

Everything is just dark when I think about it

All memories and thoughts

Just empty

I can't feel back to those moments and the feeling I felt then

When I think back to sad, scary or unpleasant moments

Can I feel them

When I think I can remember what it was that made me think and feel exactly that

But not when it comes to happy

I try

And try

And try

To think, to remember

What it was

Why I was happy

But nothing

It's just empty

And it's all pointless

I'm sitting here, full of hopelessness

And I don't want to anymore

I looked for something sharp

An old habit

A habit I've been afraid will return

A habit I didn't want to face again

One I should have said goodbye to a long time ago

But why is it back?

The craving is still there

Addiction never leaves me

I don't want any more

Can it just end?!

I've made it this far

But how much longer do I have to hold on

It's like running

And running

And running

But I never see the finish line

Everyone just runs by

One by one

Until I'm alone again

I just want to stop

Stop the thoughts

Stop the feelings

Stop the overwhelming urge

Stop everything

I'm stuck

And I can't go on

And I don't want to

I can't ask for help

I don't know what to do

Now I'm just lost

No way out

Can't even see the way I came in anymore

I'm just trapped

Without a way out or in

Just me

All alone In a dark lonely room

It's like staring at a candle

And you just wait

And wait

And wait

For it to finally burn out",depression,4,7,Kikiooolol,dont know start feel like need place rant thinking lot lately dont remeber happy sounds weird say sounds wrong realized longer know joy happines strange feel stupid unfortunately true cant remember last time felt way sometimes feel happiness joy stupid feel like im lying every time im family friends fair cant remember feeling empty thoughts memories dont understand gone dont know makes happy anymore makes smile genuine feeling feel everything dark think memories thoughts empty cant feel back moments feeling felt think back sad scary unpleasant moments feel think remember made think feel exactly comes happy try try try think remember happy nothing empty pointless im sitting full hopelessness dont want anymore looked something sharp old habit habit ive afraid return habit didnt want face one said goodbye long time ago back craving still addiction never leaves dont want end ive made far much longer hold like running running running never see finish line everyone runs one one im alone want stop stop thoughts stop feelings stop overwhelming urge stop everything im stuck cant go dont want cant ask help dont know im lost way cant even see way came anymore im trapped without way alone dark lonely room like staring candle wait wait wait finally burn
1j85w2v,2025-03-11 00:08:33,I truly hate myself,"As the title says, I really and truly hate myself. Just need to get it out there I guess. Every night as I lay down I dream of a gun in my face and it going off, or one of my favorites is thinking about being underwater and letting the water surround me. I've done it before. I was on the swim team when I was 12 and I wanted to see how drowning felt. I have to admit, it was beautiful. I got all the way down to the bottom of the pool and looked up at the lights, and just started breathing in and out slowly until the panic set in and i came back up to the surface. The bodies need for survival is very strong. 

  
I've hated myself from the time I was in 4th grade. When my mom married my stepfather I was in first grade and since then, he slowly destroyed any love I had for myself. I finally gave up in 4th grade after the many times of him screaming down my throat at how disgusting I am, how useless, ugly, stupid, and worthless. Of course my mom never stopped him. She always made excuses and kept those blinders on. Real father was never part of my life so it's not like I could go to him. By the time I was 15 I started attempting. The depression got so bad I just didn't have a will anymore. Therapy didn't help, I had a hard time staying on task anyway so it's not like I could focus enough to explain anything. So I became obsessed with sex. I can't even tell you how many men I've slept with. It was truly the only time I've ever felt desired was when a man was giving me attention. I've never felt beautiful until I got catcalled at a young age and I wanted more and more and more. The more I got the more the shame set in. The more the hatred grew. I took to any sort of drug I could get. Exstacy was my favorite cause it made me the happiest. I could dance and feel good for once. Thanks to that I almost failed out of high school, barely ever showed and as long as I was home by curfew my parents didn't mind what I did. It's not like they paid much attention to me anyway. I dated men well above my age and honestly they should be in jail. A 30 year old should not try and get a 16 year old drunk and sleep with her. At the time I didn't care too much. I also cheated on every single boyfriend I had in high school. I've ditched friends, and chose the feeling of being desired over actually healthy relationships. I craved it. At the end of high school I got with a man fresh out of jail and got pregnant. I became addicted to him because he was the personification of every negative thought I had in my head. Stupid, worthless, ugly, slut, whore. He started with pushing, then it went to slapping. I also couldn't keep him to myself. He went and got many prostitutes and brought home an uncurable disease. Not deadly. I stayed. We ended up having 3 kids together. it was 6 years of absolute hell. The beatings got worse, the manipulation. I could see the hate in his eyes. I hated him too. There were a number of times I've thought about ending myself, ending him, or ending us both. I hated him just as much as I hated myself. Finally got away, got therapy, and I'm actually in a very healthy marriage to a wonderful man that has adopted my older 3 and we had a baby together. Been together for 10 years now. I still can't get rid of the hate I have for myself. I can forget it for a bit while he's here but when I'm alone, our baby is asleep, and the older kids are in school, my mind races. Especially at night before going to bed. It happens every night. My ex pointed a gun at me before. I see that barrel every night. I'm also ashamed to tell my husband about the std. I've been extremely careful and haven't passed it along to him yet but I know it's only a matter of time. It's just when I met him and we started dating I couldn't bring myself to tell him. I know I'm evil and I know it's only making my hate for myself worse. I know it's selfish. He's the only person keeping me sane. I have a total of 2 friends because everyone else I tend to phase out. I hate leaving or going anywhere out in public, to the point where I almost have panic attacks just think about leaving. Can't keep relationships like that. My children are amazing, my husband is amazing, we aren't struggling for money, but we do have to be frugal (I don't mind, as long as we are frugal we are ok Financially) I can't tell my husband any of this because I know for a fact how much he loves and adores me. He shows me everyday. Seriously could not have asked for a better man. I adore him too. That adoration is honestly the only thing keeping me here. Because people do need me. But I still feel that disgust when I look in the mirror. I don't mind getting hurt because a part of me knows I deserve it. I have a deep feeling of wanting to die. It's there. It's always there.

For context, I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD but I’ve never really felt aligned with that diagnosis. I’ve also been diagnosed with anxiety and depression at various points. I’ve tried Adderall and I did not like how it made me feel - from what I recall, I felt jittery and irritated. 

With the Wellbutrin not working anymore, I’m curious about what my options are in terms of adding something or changing meds completely. I do not like SSRIs and the only other thing I’ve tried is the Adderall. My symptoms are: lack of motivation, trouble focusing, low mood/energy, low libido, all that good stuff.

I’ve looked a little bit into Vyvanse but I don’t know a lot about it. I’m curious to hear your experiences on adding/changing meds or how they made you feel.

You lie everyone so much that you start believing in it yourself and at the end of the day just the most broken person that u ever know. 
I started getting into depression loop when I was 11, was getting constantly bullied at school, teachers would bully me too. I closed myself in my small virtual world where nobody knows where Im from, how many cuts I have on my body and I was 100% sure Im not gonna make it past the age of 17. I thought of different scenarios of how Im gonna end myself. Drowning, jumping, hangjng, cutting, overdosing on pills. Apparently none of them appealed me. I wanted to die beautifuly. Lol. Then I moved to a different country with my mom and shes like an adult child. I took the responsibilty of taking care of her after we left grandparents house. And that made me responsible of being there for her. If I die she will get back to alcohol. 
Im 23 now, have a full time job, supporting my mom, paying for mortgage and paying for my school. Ive never been on meds, but I was harshly raised to be tough and with too many responsibilities I cant think of dying anymore. I cant even cry anymore, I dont have tears coming out.

1j897d5,2025-03-11 02:27:02,Depression is real.,"So I'm 29 and have felt this crushing weight since I was a preteen. My life went deeper into shit about a year ago when my grandparents died, my family proceeded to start getting lawyers and feuding over the money, now my cousin who was like a brother to me won't talk to me without his lawyer present because he wants the money... my mom is bipolar and schizophrenic so she actually needs the money more than anyone but my family doesn't care and thinks she should fend for herself while they inherit successful businesses and 100's of thousands. My grandparents thought my mom was bad with money, so they opted to give it all to my aunt and cousin with their assurance they'd always take care of my mom. They lied. They put my grandmother in a home and took control of her assets, and kicked my mom out before my grandmother even passed. My mom now lives in a studio with my disabled sister who gave herself brain damage via xanax abuse. And I live with my best friend, who has land so he offered to take my mom's 10 cats. Now I'm living here with him just to care for the animals so it doesn't burden him. I want to preface this by saying I love cats, I helped my mom rescue them for 15 years, that's why she has 10, the ones she couldn't adopt out. But at this point after caring for so many for so long, I'm at my wits end with it. I feel like I've done enough for cats, and I just want to find them better owners but it's very hard cause they're all around 10 yrs old. I'm almost 30, and have only ever had 1 decent relationship which ended badly for me when she got pregnant cheating on me, and let me think i could be the father so I haven't dated since, even tho as a kid all I ever wanted to be was a family man, a father. I found out she died recently from an OD, and for some reason every night i wish i had died instead. She left 2 kids behind...I no longer believe fatherhood is in the cards for me. I've lost hope. I even had to give my mom my car in order for her to be stable. Now I'm basically reliant on my best friend for shelter AND transportation, which does not feel good or fair to him. I try my best to work hard to sort of earn my keep. But there are days my depression gets the best of me, and I dont do much of anything and he notices. But he doesn't believe in depression. I try to explain to him, when you deprive a bird of sunlight by putting a sheet over its cage, it will go into a deep depression and rapidly start to die. I have been living with the sheet of depression over my cage for 15 years atleast, and I think im just ready to be done.

1j87xmm,2025-03-11 01:34:23,The only light in my life.,"I'm male, german and still in school. I have social anxiety and signs of moderate depression. (Also, sorry for my bad English)

I've always felt like I could never feel love or beeing loved, not even with my family. Even though I keep saying I love them, I dont actually mean it, since I don't feel anything like love when thinking about them.

Because of this and a few other factors, I've always felt lost, alone and like life is pointless.

But now, there's this girl in my class, we share a lot of interests and get along (she knows about my mental state). Still, even now I'm not sure if what I feel is love. It's hard to describe but I'll try...

She's not very popular since she's what you'd call a 'nerd' and she's even been bullied in the past. Because of all of that and the fact that I know how evil the rest of my class can be, I feel like I have to protect her, like I have to always be at her side. 
But I don't feel much more, I don't want to start a family or even marry her in the future.
STILL, some of the only times I truly feel happy is when I talk with her, see or even think about her...

Once school is over, I know that we'll probably part ways and I'm scared of that day. My heart aches at the thought of feeling alone again.

1j82fsh,2025-03-10 21:47:36,What the fuck is wrong with me?,"I have been feeling ""broken"" for perhaps 5 years or so. I am currently 20 years old and feel unable to live my daily life normally.

Most days I skip school, stay home, sleep maybe 10-12 hours, eat, go to the gym and hangout with my girlfriend. I am just constantly tired and numb. I dont feel like doing anything. 

Since high school I have been wondering what is wrong with me. I thought about depression, bipolarism, psycopathy and ADHD.  Currently I have an ADHD medicine prescription but it doesn't really help so I harldy take it.

My biggest problem is that I am an objective person but for the life of me can't pinpoint where the problem lies in my life. I would describe myself as almost a model son. I come from a nice home, study in the best university in my country, I am fairly good looking, well liked among my peers and women in general. I am hardworking and kind. 
I know I am smart, I am doing great in school, even though I go to class at most a few times a month. I barely return my papers in time and get good grades. 

I have struggled with addiction my whole life. I am addicted to masturbating, I can't gamble cause I'm unable to stop. I drink rarely but when drunk I feel my best. I sometimes take my medicine with alcohol when going out and I truly feel happy when doing it. I become the person I want to be socially. I talk a lot more than normal, I am brave, uplifting. I feel like everyone is more kind to me, more attracted to me and likes me better like this.

I never seem to be fully rested, even though I sleep forever. I often dream really vivid dreams, which almost always are anxious or scary and involve sex. I always feel panicked in my dreams, I am missing something, late from something, messing up etc. I also often realize that I am dreaming but unable to stop it.

I really haven't talked to anyone about my issues and dont really know what to do.

1ikae0s,2025-02-08 06:02:14,"""Is This Self-Harm?"" Megathread","The answer to this question will vary from person to person, but generally, causing yourself deliberate self injury in any way counts as self harm. 

This includes but is not limited to:

* scratching
* cutting
* burning
* interfering in the healing process of wounds
* pulling out hair
* starving
* purging
* breaking bones
* excessive drug use (including alcohol)

# Why do people self harm?

For many people, there is not one single reason why they self-harm, but rather a combination of multiple factors which ultimately push people to use self-harm as a coping mechanism. If you are self-harming, the following list may help you understand your emotions, or alternatively if you're trying to help someone who is self-harming, then understanding why they do it in the first place is important to know.

This list is non-exhaustive and not mutually exclusive.

* To match the outside to the inside. People are in so much emotional pain and they want people to know it. They want to look the same as they feel.
* To punish themselves. Extreme self-loathing leads to the need to punish oneself for failings (real or imagined).
* To numb themselves. The pain releases endorphins, just like drugs can. It produces a numbing effect on the mind which is difficult to explain. It helps people forget depression for a bit.
* To keep control. One's own body sometimes seems like the only thing they can control, and the pain they inflict on it. When everything else in life goes wrong and there seems to be nothing you can do, cutting is the one thing you can control.
* As a shock to a numb mind. An awful emotionlessness often accompanies depression. Often, the pain of cutting is enough to snap a person out of this kind of apathetic haze.
* To self-medicate. Many people with mental illnesses of all sorts use cutting as others might use Prozac. It makes people feel normal again, by snapping them out of the cloying darkness that's so difficult to avoid by conventional means.
* As an addiction. A lot of people start cutting for one of the reasons listed above, but then continue because they're addicted to the sudden, low exchange, rush of endorphins.

1j8mggy,2025-03-11 14:31:10,Why does one cut hurt more than the other?,"WARNING: pretty deliberate description of self harm method, read at own discretion.

So, I’ve been self-harming for about a year or so. Scissors have always been the most accessible to me, the only exception being kitchen knives. I never dared using those. Instead, I would grab a pair of scissors and scrape it against my skin until it bled “enough”. The cut would hurt for about a week, then heal. Sometimes (probably way too often) it would get infected and I’d find myself almost unable to move whatever limb I’d cut myself on. Once, it got so bad I had to tell my parents about the wound because I seriously couldn’t move my arm without immense (ish) pain. I told them that our cat had scratched me. 
This method of self harming at least kept me from doing it too often. Maybe once a month or less; I wasn’t all that consistent. 

Two days ago I relapsed, having been a couple months clean. I opted for the same pair of scissors I normally use, cutting my right thigh. I also cut the following day, on my left thigh, but with a small blade I found in one of the kitchen drawers. It bled a lot more than my other cut, yet it was so much less painful. My right leg has hurt ever since. Moving is painful but it’s bearable. I don’t feel any pain from the cuts on my left leg. Even seconds after I’d cut it, it honestly just tickled. I suppose it could be because the cut on my right leg is deeper but I’m not sure if it’s deep enough to make such a discernible difference. Perhaps it’s infected but it’s so fresh and I doubt it.

1j8lrng,2025-03-11 13:35:27,"Are my cuts ""good enough?""","       I cut myself a little bit around 6 months ago then stopped after resorting to cannabis for relief. I recently started again but much much worse. 

       My new standard for a cut has to be at least as deep as the worst ones from that period, (enough to draw blood drops) and when I decide to cut it never feels like enough. I usually end up cutting myself around 15 times per ""session"" and have two sessions per day, for the past 4 days. I had a rough one today and I now have a total of over a hundred cuts total just on my thigh in a 6x6 inch area, with an other 50 or so on my ankle (theyre older and have healed). I feel so guilty that I'm not going deep enough and that I'm not cutting enough times. I've cut enough times that it feels hot to the touch in the middle (theyre not infected). Moving my leg hurts and aches after short use, especially after going up stairs. 

       I feel so bad that I'm undermining people who are actually hurting. I just want to keep cutting more and more. I feel guilty posting because I've only been cutting for around a week total minus the first few cuts. I feel like I'm stealing something from the actual victims.

1j8fn23,2025-03-11 07:14:53,Blood STI tests: theoretically could just collect the blood from when SH rather than prick my finger repeatedly?,"This might be the most ridiculous question I've ever asked but I'm a chronic self harmer and the idea just hit me. 

So I did a full STD panel recently. I don't suspect I've got anything but after being with one sexual partner for months, that ended and I'm prepared for the possibility that I might end up with someone else in the future so I want a clean bill of health before sleeping with someone new as proof I'm clean. The way it works in my area is they send out a kit and you send in a blood sample taken from a finger prick (capillary blood), an internal vag swab and a mouth swab for afab people, I am a trans man with a vag so that's the kits I got sent). 

Everything came back fine from my mouth and internal swab except my blood sample which clotted so they couldn't test it. Got a new kit sent out and I've been putting off doing it because last time it took two finger pricks and about 15 minutes of squeezing my finger to get the blood out. Well I'm a chronic self harmer medically speaking ranging from superficial to severe. It's gotten to a point where mental health services don't even try to get me to stop anymore, I'm just told to go to A&E or urgent care when I need stitches and use clean tools have a first aid kit call for help if I take it too far yada yada. It is what it is.

So I ended up cutting tonight and looking at the blood I got the thought, would I technically be able to use the blood from my self harm to send off for testing? It says they use the capillary blood from the finger prick to test so if I just make sure to not hit anything serious, surely it'd be the same blood right just much easier to collect from a small cut rather than a tiny finger prick? I can follow the same process the kit outlines, use the sterile wipe before releasing the blood, the same entire process except collect the blood from a cut not a finger prick.

I mean, I'm gonna be self harming anyway so why not use it to my benefit for getting this sample rather than just do it and waste the blood right? If it works? 

Or am I just coming up with some stupid asf idea right now? I don't know it's nearly 2am, I'm a little bit high and I've just calmed down from breaking down to samaritans after cutting.

I’ve been very overwhelmed for weeks. Had a repressed trauma that I didn’t know was there, start to surface and it’s been wrecking me. It’s really bad and I only have pieces and am not really sure what happened. It seems like it may be CSA but I’m not sure yet. 

I’ve been having multiple panic attacks daily. My dissociation is always there but it has been worse and I’ve had times where I’ve gone catatonic. It’s happened a few times in therapy. It’s happened before in the past but is much more common now. 

I’m working with my therapist twice per week and psychiatrist every two weeks in a row and again next week. 

I also have chronic pain and my joint pain has been awful. It’s all of my joint and I have joint instability and possibly enler dahlos syndrome. 

I also injured my leg. I felt my kneecap move in a way it shouldn’t. I’ve dislocated my kneecap and did a lot of damage on the other side in high school. It felt like it moved in a similar way but much less severely. I have similar but lesser symptoms too. Everything hurts badly, I’m limping, my foot angle is off to the right when it usually is more straight. I’ve lied down and cried several times this past week because of the pain and usually I can take it without crying. 

I also have been having very strong pmdd symptoms which elevates everything and makes me miserable. It makes my pain worse and I get emotional swings and feel more frustrated and angry and sad and depressed. I also get more self harm urges during that. I also have CPTSD, severe recurrent depression, panic disorder, AuDHD an eating disorder and several other chronic conditions. My conditions have made me disabled and I’m struggling to take care of myself. I’m also a trans woman and this has been an incredibly stressful time. 

On top of all of that I relapsed again. 

I self harmed badly again this weekend on Saturday and Sunday. I feel very deep shame and a lot of self hate about it. 

I was doing better and my skills and strategies  had been working even though it had been extremely difficult to not self harm for days. The urges have been very strong. 

I was doing better with it and I know it’s bad to do and that I’ll hate the scars and it won’t help. I started and then it was extremely difficult to stop. I would and then would start shaking and want to do more so bad. It felt euphoric at some points too. I was able to stop and cover my hand and bandage it and haven’t since last night. I showed my therapist and we talked about it. I had two panic attacks in therapy and went nonverbal at the end again. 

I feel so fucking stupid and deeply ashamed and I hate that I did that. Plus it hurts a lot too. I talked to my therapist about it today and we are working on it. My hand is a mess and I have it covered and bandaged and with ointment on it. I am anxious too because I’ll have to answer questions about my hand and I live with my sister temporarily and she’ll either be really judgy or will ignore it. My friends will be worried too. Which also makes me anxious. 

I’m just so fucking tired. I just wanted to vent I guess. Honestly may just delete this. I think I’m going to just stay in bed the rest of today and try to rest and take care of myself.

1j7icas,2025-03-10 03:05:16,I had to clean up my boyfriend’s self harm,"Last night I had one of the most traumatic experiences of my life. For context I am someone who has self harmed for years and while i’ve being trying to stop I always seem to relapse eventually. My boyfriend on the other hand has only ever tried to once, five or so years ago which he told me he stopped immediately in the moment. But last night he tried again. He’s been in a really bad place these past weeks with stress and it just led him to think of suicide. I can’t even think about the moment clearly despite the fact i can’t escape the image, but he was telling me that he was thinking about ending it and how useless he felt. And he said he needed me to come over and of course I did because I was scared to leave him alone. But then half way there he told me not to come and that he was fine, I still came anyway and opened the door to watch him walk away from me and to bed. When I went to go see if he was ok I saw it. Blood down his arm along with his refusal to look at me. I couldn’t help but start sobbing, I went to the bathroom to find something to stop the bleeding and found blood on the floor and the razor he used. I didn’t know what to do, I’ve never felt so sick and guilty and scared. I just started cleaning, scrubbing at the floor while I cried. Eventually he came in the bathroom and started apologising, I just started cleaning his arm and the cuts.

When the light hits my body just right in the dark of my room all of the scars glow. Hidden underneath the glory on top, the old ones die but int the dim light they are just as clear. My body becames a cascade of rippling skin, the plasticy scar tissue shines. My skin looks like hair. My hair  smells like tortilla chips when i dont shower.

Im so alone. I dont know if i want to stay that  way.

Its not that i feel unlovable, people love me, i know they do, i dont deserve it. I refuse to bask in the light of their love, i avoid it like the plague. If they love me theyll hurt, i dont know if they love me i dont think they hurt. No one ever said anything ive completely dissapeared i killed myself and no one noticed im a ghost floating through the life of someone they loved and they dont know the difference. Or they pretend to ignore it.

This makes me feel so alone.

And i dont know when they choose to not tell me things and when im just supposed to know these things and when its okay to ask whats going on and when they dont want me to know. I forget things.

The thing is that i have no family. No its actually worse than that : my family shows me right in the face everyday that they dont care and dont respect me at all. My home is pure abuse and thats it. 

And i have *no* friends. The only person im close to is a p*d0phile/gro0m*r. I know his intentions r disgusting but i never had anyone by my side ever so i just dont care, i cant have the luxury to refuse people because they have bad intentions. If they r respectful then its okay, thats the only criteria i have. Also i tried to make news friends SO HARD but since im autistic i guess people runaway from me idk

Ive had pills, i tried seriously to stop sh (i achieved to stop for 6 months+), i started new studies that interest me, i cut off with the p3d0 quite a few times but noticed that if i am alone and i have no one to talk to my problem with then its literally SOnmuch worse, im in therapy since im 8yo, i tried to ask help about the abuse in my family and the woman that worked there believed me and write down the things i was saying then she met my family and believed all their lies about how « good parents they were », 

I just dont know what to do anymore. I tried to just keep going and hope for the best for the past 5 years but there is no results. That just dont work.

1iwvbzn,2025-02-24 11:40:37,r/Anxiety is looking for new moderators,"Hello friends!

We're looking to grow the moderation team here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/). Moderators are a key part of what makes any Reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What does a moderator do?

Moderators here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of anxiety and the ways that anxiety and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about the topic of anxiety and the r/Anxiety community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)

# What are the expectations for users who join the r/Anxiety moderation team?

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Anything I should know before I apply?

Yes, [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/Anxiety ?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

I’m crying right now. I’m battling with depression and anxiety. I feel so hopeless. I just got home from a doctor’s appointment. It’s been six months since I left my job and focus on my treatment. Since then my routine is only home and hospital. I just finished my 6 cycles of chemo which is so bad physically and mentally!! 

Now, I need to check in to my OB gyne for my maintenance medicine for 5-10 years which also have a side effect that makes someone lonely and more depressed and anxious. Need to start my radiation which 2.5 hours away from home. 

I live in a third world country, we’re poor and no car. I asked my doctor about my concern because I started my chemo so late almost 3 months after my surgery and I’m so afraid that it has spread. He said that no one can answer it and just gave me a referral to get a PET scan. They don’t offer it in my place so I have to travel 4-5 hours and it’s really expensive!! 

I’m just so tired. I’m just so tired of this life!! My life is just revolving around my treatment which cannot give me a guarantee of long life either. Until when do I need to have this depression and anxiety?! Waking up in the middle of the night with a pounding heart and always thinking of a worse case scenario. I am hopeless.

I’m feeling really overwhelmed right now and could use some advice. I recently took a reaction test on a website because I play video games and was curious about my reaction time. It seemed like a simple, fun test, but somehow, I ended up in a subscription I never intended to sign up for.  
I only realized it when I noticed unexpected charges, and now I can’t seem to cancel it. Their website doesn’t have a clear cancellation option, and when I try to contact them, I either get no response or just generic replies that don’t help. It’s making my anxiety spiral - I keep imagining worst-case scenarios, like endless charges I can’t stop or having to go through a long, exhausting dispute process.  
I know I need to handle this, but right now, I feel frozen by stress. Has anyone else dealt with something similar? How do you manage the overwhelming feeling of being stuck in situations like this?  
Would really appreciate any advice on how to handle this anxiety. Right now, it feels like I’m drowning in it.

1j8d3sr,2025-03-11 05:12:50,Can't drink a cup of coffee any longer,"I am just curious if this is normal. I used to be a huge coffee drinker. I could drink 3 cups in a sitting. Coffee was one of my signature activities.

Now one cup of coffee gives me uncomfortable anxiety. Caffeine used to fuel my vacations, but on my last trip to Europe in October 2024, I couldn't handle *one* cup in the morning. I was fine on my trip in 2023, in contrast.

My tolerance doesn't appear to be going back to normal either. I have switched to Green Tea. I suspect the anxiety is related to the cummulative damage to my digestive system. I have bad acid reflux and can't handle red meat or beer any longer either. My body just reads the stimulant as a threat.

Its strange watching people in their 70's drinking multiple cups of coffee, like it's nothing. I can't even handle one cup. 

I'm just curious if others have had a similar experience and whether they somehow got over it (I'm not optimistic).

*I have a history of depression, anxiety, ADHD, and PTSD. and am also using prescription medication. But drinking coffee was never a problem until 2023 and I can't drink coffee even without stimulant meds. I used to be able to use them together with no problems. Now I can't even drink coffee solo.

Some days it's completely absent, some days mild, some days fairly strong, there seems to be no clear trend either way.

There are no other symptoms involved although I do have a history of severe cervigogenic headaches at times. On examination there was no nystagmus.

1j8n7mp,2025-03-11 15:28:31,Vivid images and gibberish/word salad train of thoughts.,"For context: I recently had a bad full panic attack a week ago. 

After that panic episode- I feel like I went through a different stages, mentally. 

First, I am literally anxious of everything. I’m scared of my own thoughts. I get anxious of getting another panic attack. And I am REALLY DEEP in fear of psychosis, schizophrenia, delusion and hallucination themed anxiety. 

Second- The depression, brain fog and dpdr that comes after a panic episode. Everyday feels like I’m watching my surrounding in 4K high definition.   I am aware of my surroundings at the same time it feels foreign to me. I feel  disconnected from my emotions. From crying for days to I can’t cry, i mean, I still can but I can’t express my full genuine emotions. And I hate that I had to go through this again. First time I experienced dpdr was in 2017 It was both traumatizing and horrible experience.

Lastly, I been having troubling sleeping for more than a week now.  I would sleep at around 10-11am and wake up at 5pm (if I’m lucky) 
I struggle to get an undisturbed sleep because the moment I closed my eyes I get these vivid imagery. How do I explain this, It’s like watching a video from a 3rd person’s perspective? You’re like dreaming while your mind is still fully conscious. Like I always get these vivid images of people that I am not familiar with doing their own business like chores and stuff and converse. It doesn’t usually bother me but then I get these gibberish train thoughts (inner voices) that speaks in word salad that’s doesn’t make any sense. Sometimes I was in the middle of having internal monologue or self talk inside my head and all of sudden I caught myself cursing and thinking gibberish which causing me so much distress cos I feel like I am in a prodromal stage of psychosis or schizophrenia. I’d become hyper fixated with that and start googling stuff, seeking reassurance and constantly asking myself “did I just have psychosis episode?” “Was that a delusional thought” repeatedly that is makes me more anxious and scared. I really don’t want to go insane. It’s frustrating how panic attack, intrusive thoughts can do all these things when I was just living my life weeks ago :( 

I already booked an appointment to a psychiatrist. 
But my schedule is on April 24. I might go back to medication again and I feel so sad about it after being off meds for a year.. I really hate this having to go through this again.

1j8k5dj,2025-03-11 11:33:25,Can't decide if I just have a maladaptive coping mechanism or if something else is going on,"So I (20m) have been dealing with this... thing in my mind for about three years. I say thing because I'm not sure what it is. I have diagnosed disorders, including dissociative tendencies, but I also have an over active imagination, along with a lovely history of multiple sources of trauma. I am barely getting over said trauma and I am becoming aware of maladaptive coping mechanisms that I have developed over time. 

About three years ago during a period of involuntary social withdrawal (emotionally unstable mother/always sucked at being social appropriate/kids at school turned out to be liars) if about a year I wrote a random silly story and I drew one of the characters. And well I thought he looked pretty hot, and instantly I fell in love with this drawing. It wasn't a remarkable drawing, just a doodle. I immediately started fantasizing about a life with this man, had nothing to do with the story, I just fell in love with how he looked, and I created someone in my mind I could fantasize about, and how much I would've loved for him to come get me out of my unfortunate circumstances. And this persisted, I said at the beginning that I was in complete control of it and as long as I wasn't having hallucinations then it wasn't anything concerning. Well obviously it spiraled out of control, more and more I just wanted to find *him*, wherever he was, so that he could help me get my life together, and I started to believe he was real. I imagined every way we could meet, and I always was thinking of him, and waiting, and how my life would be happy and he would be there. 

Well I haven't always had the best luck with dating, and that wasn't changing any time soon, you don't need to be dating when you're a teenager, but I was a dropout. Whenever I was able to go out, I was always looking for him around the corner, but he was never there. I went off to job corps, and was obsessed with hoping he would be there, and nothing could prevent us from being together, I began to believe he was real, I began to imagine his memories, I made up his whole life and I started to convince myself it was real, and that he was coming, I just had to wait. Well whoopsies got kicked out(no I'm not telling) on my 18th birthday, got sent home right to the pit of my trauma, and it took me three months to get a grip on myself, acknowledge that I was a damn adult, and I hopped out the window to go be homeless cus my mom was not ready for me to independent at all, but she was only making mental dysfunction even worse and it was the best option for me. Well now I was out on the streets, running around with this delusion of a savior partner, if only we would meet, and I started getting connected with resources that would help me get on my feet, and two months later I got myself a job, but whoopsies, burned out too hard because my mental health was still junk and couldn't handle working, had adequate work performance for 7 months, except for all the gaps when I didn't, and then at the end I was given an ultimatum and I quit. Took the last paycheck and drove six hours to a whole new town, convinced myself he must be there, oh yes I didn't stop thinking every day that I just had to keep working and he would show up and my life would ""begin"" and I wouldn't have to worry about a financial or companionship need ever again. Lol, that still wasn't in the cards for me, and I slept in my car for three weeks waiting for him to show up, very embarrassing looking back now, and well because he's not real, he's not real at all, he has never breathed a breath of air, he didn't show up. Week long phsyc ward visit later and I took this ring I had gotten for him and I threw it off a bridge, really wish I would've waited longer to try to sell it but oh well. And it had been a whole year of homelessness between the two towns combined and I got myself into a transitional living facility, and started working on dismantling this thing.

During this time I fought tooth and nail with myself to force myself into any relationship that was at least with an actual person, lol nope still not in the cards for me, so I gave up on dating apps or hookups, I really did try to be social in public too, but I couldn't seem to find anyone in my age range, so I've just thrown my arms up and given up on even trying. I forgot to mention that beyond the delusions of thinking this man was real, I also believed he was God and that I had a duty to love him to restore power to God so that I could escape Earth, that whole thing in the middle, very embarrassing. I told a therapist that I had(past tense) delusions of grandeur and he remarked that usually people don't break their own delusions, well I did, so that's that. I mention this because there was very much an alleged spiritual aspect to this, or at least I thought so, but everything has pointed me in the direction of ""no he's not real or your soul mate, drop it"" which I am trying to do, but I can't. And that's my problem.

I moved up to live with family in a third town, and I'm going to college, my grades are good and I'm getting better each day. But he's still there. I've tried all sorts of prayer, I've tried to villanize him, I've tried to ignore urges to seek him out, I've tried so much to make myself understand that just because my mom was unhinged that doesn't mean the rest of my family is, I've tried to surround myself with social support so that I won't feel like thinking of him, but he's always there, always there to hold me, always there to accompany me. Now let me be clear, I have never had a visual/auditory hallucination in my life. I have never spoken to him, and he has never spoken to me, he exists entirely within my imagination. And that's what's bothering me, and what has led me to believe that he is just a maladaptive coping mechanism, my brain provided me a companion during a very traumatic and isolated part of my life and now I can't make him go away, he is going to be there until he is no longer needed. And I don't think that's fair, I don't think it's fair that I can't figure out what this thing is, that both mental and spiritual work has not gotten rid of him, how could it? I structured my whole survival off of finding him, I imagined a life time together with him. When I say I thought of him all the time, I meant it, I wanted him every minute of the day. I've gotten far enough over the last year to at least be willing to say he's not real, but there's still that part of me that is holding out for him, and I just want it gone, I want that energy and hope to help in other parts of my healing, I don't want to hold on to it anymore, I don't know what's wrong with me, and I'm tired of having to restart therapy because I keep moving and now I'm in a small ass town that doesn't have a wide variety of therapists to choose from, not anyone who's specially trained for whatever is wrong with me, and this damn imaginary friend/dissociative business always gets steamrolled by all the other damn trauma I still haven't processed and I don't know how to get help for it because I can't even label it, it's treatment resistant, I refuse to take antipsychotics because I do not have schizophrenia and when I was placed on Abilify wayyy before this whole business started (about 9 months before that fateful date for 7 days, forced on to me because I kept ""lashing out"" and yelling at my mom because she victimized me) I felt awful, constant leg tremors and fatigue that made me actually unstable, and I feel like restricting my dopamine would just kill my personality, I think it would kill ""me"". Antidepressants (SSRI's/SNRI's) do not work on me at all, tried them for years and years and only got fat from them, (they also don't work if you're actually stuck in a traumatic living environment where you're constantly exposed to hopelessness/helplessness) antianxiety meds actively make me depressed, and all I got out of this is an OCD diagnosis, still don't know what to do with it. 

I just- I don't need a relationship, having one entirely in my mind has just burned me out. But he's still there, to fill in the gaps whenever some part of me calls out to him, always a loyal companion, taunting me with what I can't have. I wish I could look at my family and feel cared for. I wish I could sit by myself without dissociating/daydreaming. I wish I could pin point what this was, and make it stop. He won't go away until he is no longer needed, but you know that idea of ""if you keep wishing for something you're not gonna get it""? Well I believe that, and I believe that I just don't get to have a relationship in this life, not as long as he won't go away. I want him gone because I now believe he is stopping me from enjoying life and recovering. Or should I just accept it? Should I stop feeling so distressed about his presence? I just get so sad cuddling with my pillows, I don't want to be so obsessed with a romantic relationship, I wish I could believe my family and friends when they say they care, I want to live life in the moment, and not in some far off place in my mind.

1j8lead,2025-03-11 13:06:27,"Have you ever wondered if the feeling of being broken is just anxiety distorting your perception, rather than a reflection of your true self?","There’s a quiet voice in many of us that whispers, “You’re broken.” It’s subtle, persistent, and often feels true. But what if that voice is lying? What if anxiety, with all its trembling shadows, isn’t telling the truth about who you are?

The Lie of Anxiety

Anxiety is like a master storyteller. It weaves narratives that seem believable—stories of failure, isolation, and inadequacy. It convinces you that because you’re struggling, you’re broken. But struggling doesn’t mean broken; it means human.

I remember sitting alone one evening, feeling crushed under the weight of my own thoughts. Every mistake, every moment of awkwardness, played on repeat in my mind. I was sure I was defective, fundamentally flawed. Anxiety had built a convincing argument, and I believed it.

But the thing about anxiety is that it doesn’t tell you the whole story. It’s like looking through a fogged-up window—you only see the distortions, not the truth. And the truth is: you are not broken. You are a person facing difficult emotions, and that makes you brave, not broken.

The Personal Battle

In my own experience, anxiety often felt like carrying an invisible weight. I’d show up at work, smile, and joke, but inside, it felt like I was drowning. I thought, “If I was stronger, I wouldn’t feel like this.” But that wasn’t true. Strength isn’t about not feeling anxious; it’s about continuing despite it.

There were days when even getting out of bed felt like a victory. And though it didn’t feel like strength at the time, I see now that it was. Strength isn’t always bold or loud. Sometimes, it’s quiet, like getting through the day even when your mind feels like it’s against you.

A Deeper Truth from the Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita, an ancient spiritual guide, offers wisdom on inner strength and clarity. In Chapter 6, Verse 5, it says:

""One must elevate, not degrade oneself by one's own mind. The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.""

This verse is a powerful reminder that while the mind can be our greatest enemy, feeding us lies of brokenness, it can also be our greatest friend. The challenge is learning to recognize when our mind is telling the truth and when it’s just echoing fear.

Srila Prabhupada's Perspective

Srila Prabhupada, a spiritual teacher, once said:
""The real problem is not external difficulties, but the mind that perceives them. When we learn to control the mind, true peace is possible.""

It’s profound, really. The battle isn’t with the world, but with the way our mind interprets the world. Anxiety isn’t an external enemy—it’s an internal challenge. And it can be faced, understood, and eventually quieted.

You Are Not Broken

If you’re feeling like anxiety has shattered you, remember this: you are not the sum of your anxious thoughts. You are the observer of those thoughts. You are the person still standing, still trying, still hoping.

Anxiety lies. It tells you that you’re alone, that you’re weak, that you’re broken. But every day you get up, every time you show kindness to someone else, every moment you breathe through the fear—that’s proof that you’re whole. Maybe not perfect, but whole.

What Helps?

Self-Compassion: Treat yourself like you would a friend. If a friend told you they felt broken, you wouldn’t confirm it—you’d reassure them. Give yourself that same grace.

Mindfulness: Notice when anxiety is telling you stories. You don’t have to believe every thought.

Connection: Talk to someone. Anxiety thrives in silence. Sharing your experience doesn’t make you weak; it makes you human.

Spiritual Reflection: Whether it’s prayer, meditation, or simply reflecting on deeper truths, grounding yourself can offer perspective.


You are not broken. You are becoming. You are learning how to live with your mind, how to walk through the dark and still find light. And that is not weakness. That is courage.

I've had enough. I'm so done with this. I've lived most of my life with social anxiety and whatever. It's been a living hell trying to talk to people or present in class but now my stupid brain comes up with *this*??

It's been over a year. I seem to overthink in social and even quiet settings and start to manually swallow my saliva. I can try to hold it in my mouth but I just start salivating more. I have to do this awkward gulp that people can probably notice. It's like I get hyper aware of my swallowing and can't act normal. I'll try to mask the sound of me swallowing with some other noise or by drinking water. But this is getting old.

What is wrong with me?? Why can't I be normal? My social anxiety + whatever this is = ruining my social life, college grades, mental health.

1j8l0s5,2025-03-11 12:37:24,Memory loss worries and constant rumination about memory loss,"Hi there, I've noticed an uptick in my anxiety since the new year and in the last month, I've been living in a constant-state of rumination about memory loss. This ultimately was triggered by me trying to recall when I got off my Prozac last year and when I couldn't remember the specifics, I had a full blown panic attack (roughly 3 weeks ago). I was on 30 MG Prozac for 3 years to treat a similar rumination pattern that was diagnosed as GAD and DPDR. I got off the medication last April because I felt that my symptoms had improved and the medication was unnecessary. I can't recall if my memory was poor at that time, but I was so fixated on my consciousness that I don't think I cared much to be insightful about my memory. Since then, I've been hyper analyzing my memory. I'm a server and since I've returned to work from my vacation, I will look at regulars and wonder the last time I spoke to them and what we discussed (essentially intrusive thoughts) and I will feel physical anxiety if I can't recall. I don't rememember telling people things during this time, and recently recalling longterm memories has been a challenge as well. When I'm not actively thinking about memory, I feel really ""brain foggy."" I'm curious to know if anyone else struggles with OCD-type rumination about memory and if anxiety also impacts their longterm memory as well?

1j8krz5,2025-03-11 12:19:40,My Health Anxiety/OCD is ruining my life,"*trigger warning: mention of suicide*

Hello, I’m writing this as I’m unable to fall asleep because of my extremely annoying thoughts and physical symptoms. F, 24. I’ve always had anxiety and ocd “behaviour” my entire life. When I was 10, my family and I were at my aunt & uncle’s house and I was sitting on the sofa watching TV and the news was on. I remember watching a news report on suicide and from that moment on until 2 years later, I had severe anxiety/ extreme fear of anything related to what I had heard in that news report. I would feel faint & freak out whenever I saw ropes, & bridges because I was scared to lose control over my own self and commit suicide (which I did not want to do). One day 2 years later, the obsession left. But switched to being terrified of anything paranormal after watching paranormal activities. I could not sleep with my leg out of the sheet. I had to sleep with my head under the covers and it would take me so long to fall asleep. I spent so many nights awake staring at the ceiling and corners of my room in fear. That lasted until I was 14 years old. After that I got into a relationship and I guess that was enough distraction for my mind for a while. 

Then when I was 17 and prom and graduation were getting closer, I was convinced I was going to get into a car crash on prom night and I would never get to live after highschool. Of course, this obsession started after watching this “drinking and driving” prevention presentation they made us watch. I had such a hard time enjoying my actual prom because of it. 

Between 18-20 I developed an eating disorder and was obsessed with what I was eating than binged at night. I had a bit of health anxiety but nothing too severe. 

Then at 21, I moved away from home with my boyfriend at the time and I developed really intense ROCD to the point where it drove me insane. This all ended when I couldn’t take it anymore and ended the relationship. 

Throughout all of these times in my life, I was still able to function like a “normal” human being until last year. I’ve been working in restaurants since I was 15, I started as a cook, then server, then bartender. I’ve always been able to manage the stress of a rush quite easily, until June of last year. I felt myself getting out of breath and dizzy on buzzy nights bartending, as if my body couldn’t handle the stress anymore. I left that job as I thought it was the environment and got myself a new restaurant job. But things started getting worse. I became completely unable to handle an evening rush, I would get dizzy, out of breath, if I ever bent down and got up too fast, things would spin and my vision would go black and it felt like the inside of my mind would shake. This happened a few times within a month, so I booked a doctors appointment to see why this would happen. The doctor said it was probably just low blood pressure, to have some salt and that everything was fine. My blood tests came back normal. And the head rushes never happened again after that. After that I started becoming incredibly sensitive to caffeine. I would get heart palpitations and I’d feel shaky for hours. But my symptoms were on and off. I also started to feel myself being more tense, and emotional. I also noticed that certain foods would give me brain fog, like fries and fatty foods, and I would get very sick when drinking alcohol. Then in October, at around 2am, after having gone to a comedy show where I had tater tots and a caesar, I woke up with the most intense stomach pains ever, I wasn’t sure which way it was going to come out and as I sat on the toilet, I felt a huge quick squeeze in my chest, I gasped for air and my heart was beating extremely fast. I immediately thought I was having a heart attack. I called the ambulance and as I waited for them everything went back to normal, I felt fine. But I still went to  the hospital to get tests. Blood tests and EKG came back normal. The doctor said it was probably a gallbladder attack, he prescribed me anti-acids (which I didn’t take) and sent me home. 

That’s when things got worse, I began having really bad acid reflux, upper stomach pains, heart palpitations, several panic attacks. I was afraid to shower, to get up from the sofa (it would make me dizzy and I would feel my heart beating fast), I couldn’t workout anymore, go up stairs. Anything that involved my heart beating slightly faster. I stopped doing pretty much everything. I’d get panic attacks walking on the street, and I couldn’t stand being alone at home. I was terrified of something bad happening. I visited the ER several times, all tests came back clear. I had a hard time eating anything cause my stomach would hurt. I lost 15lbs in 1-2 months, and my life. I was consumed by what was happening to me I struggled doing anything else. New symptoms appeared every day, Christmas break was awful, I couldn’t enjoy half the food, my stomach was in so much pain, and I was in panic mode 24/7. I got an upper endoscopy, came back clear, stomach ultrasound was clear too, last blood tests showed I was slightly anemic & that’s all. Last time I went to my doctor he prescribed me lexapro, sent me home & then dropped me as I lived too tar from him. I haven’t started lexapro as I’m scared of side effects and now I have no doctor to follow up with. I’ve been going to therapy bi-weekly. I try to meditate and focus on breathing and doing all of these methods to calm me down but nothing really helps. 

I swear i’m getting all of the symptoms possible. I can’t even go a day without feeling odd. But now it’s even ruining my career. I’m an actress and I booked a commercial that flew me to Mexico City. The day I was confirmed I was so anxious of flying that I had a panic attack. Then I arrived in Mexico City, had a huge migraine, thought I was dying but slept it off, the next day I felt my body extremely tense, I couldn’t calm down, my heart rate was consistently between 110-130 and I felt weak & dizzy. The next day was even worse I had a hard time standing up and doing anything without my heart rate jumping to 130. I tried to focus on breathing but nothing lowered my heart rate. I saw a doctor who gave me a complex B injection to relax all of my muscles as everything was tense and gave me prozac. But I can’t get myself to take the prozac because all of the potential side effects. Anyways all that to say, they had to replace me. I don’t get to shoot the commercial I booked because my ‘fight or flight’ was on and I couldn’t relax. I lost the opportunity of a lifetime, I lost a big amount of money which would have solved my financial situation, and now I feel extremely embarrassed that whatever is happening to me has stopped me from taking my career to the next level. 

I’m honestly at a loss of what to do and no one around me understands what i’m going through as they haven’t suffered through anxiety and can’t comprehend what’s happening to me.

It’s not necessarily blurry but something is off. I’ve gotten every eye scan and everything is normal. They told me it’s eye strain or maybe ocular migraines. But I am just fearful maybe they are missing something bigger because I can’t get it to go away.

1j8gsbu,2025-03-11 08:12:18,Ramblings,"Anyone else feel almost addicted to their anxiety in a strange way? That tense feeling is just constantly in my stomach, and theres a perpetual tightness in my diaphragm that I cant shake. But its become almost like some kind of companion along the way, an affirmation that things are shit and I’m feeling shit and I’m alive. 

I’ve been seeing a new therapist recently. I cant tell if we click yet or not but she did say something in one of our sessions that gave me a lightbulb moment. I was explaining to her that this terrible anxiety made its way into my life at the age of about 11/12. Before that I was a happy go lucky kid. Still kinda desperate for approval and to be “good” but I wasn’t marked by this anxiousness thats now almost a character trait at this point. At some point something must have happened (I have no idea what, still trying to get to the bottom of that but most likely never will) and I just started to hate school. I’d wake up in the morning and want to go straight back to sleep. I wasn’t bullied or anything and I had friends in school too. But I started making excuses that I was sick and then I’d get to stay home. After a while my mom started becoming pushy and was kinda like “hey you have to just try and go in” but that didn’t deter me. I was determined not to go to school. From the ages of 12-18 I would be “sick” from school about a month every school year. I’d tell my mom I had stomach cramps, and in an effort to convince her that “no I’m actually sick this time I swear!!” I’d like make myself get sick. With some weird placebo self-trickery I would basically convince myself I had a pain in my stomach, which would subsequently lead to me getting a pain in my stomach and feeling nauseous (magic!). I think part of convincing myself it was real was to get rid of the guilt of lying to my mom. 

But throughout all this, my mom would never make me go to school. Even though we never really addressed it til I got older, she obviously knew I was putting it on but she never forced me to go in, and would collect me from school when I ‘felt sick’. After telling my therapist all of this she tells me while we don’t know the exact cause of the anxiety the reason its stuck around for so long is because I was always rewarded for it. Feel anxious = get to stay home from school. Feel anxious = reward/protection/no conflict. Thats the connection my brain has made. And this line of thinking has really dug its claws in me. I make excuses to myself to avoid facing my anxiety. Or sometimes I’ll convince myself I’m sick so I don’t have to go to college. Except this time I’m on my own, the only person I’m lying to is myself. And I still carry that guilt of lying to people to get out of things I don’t want to do.

1j8kc2a,2025-03-11 11:46:53,Any tips to help me calm down?,"So, I've been overthinking a lot lately, to the point I'm paranoid to use Google out of fear I'll send something to someone. 

I once sent a video on my high school groupchat but deleted it immediately (a lot of people saw it, and my best friend that I know for 8+ years laughed at me, which hurt a bit) and I think that situation is the main reason of my current problem. I started being very cautious about what I did, and every smallest error made me paranoid and overthink ""what if someone else got that message?"", ""what if it got shared to someone else and I can't see it?"". It got to the point where I had trouble sleeping, and I had to constantly check my contacts just to see if I didn't send anything to anybody. (around every 3-5 minutes except for when I was at school, unless I felt like I really had to) 

I'm very sensitive to other people's opinions, and that's probably why I'm so afraid I'll accidentally send them something embarrassing. When my brain reminded me of the ""share"" option on chrome, I started to get paranoid over that too. I can't use my browser normally because I'm just scared. And I keep overthinking that I sent something embarrassing or inappropriate to somebody, even though I know I didn't! I know it's not worth overthinking, and that eventually I'll leave and never see those people again but my brain doesn't accept that answer. Does anybody have tips to calm down? I really want to vent to my friends, but they're always taking everything jokingly, and I don't feel comfortable opening up to them. (That's why I vent out to strangers on Reddit) ",anxiety,1,1,carthwei_-3,ive overthinking lot lately point im paranoid use google fear ill send something someone sent video high school groupchat deleted immediately lot people saw best friend know years laughed hurt bit think situation main reason current problem started cautious every smallest error made paranoid overthink someone else got message got shared someone else cant see got point trouble sleeping constantly check contacts see didnt send anything anybody around every minutes except school unless felt like really im sensitive peoples opinions thats probably im afraid ill accidentally send something embarrassing brain reminded share option chrome started get paranoid cant use browser normally im scared keep overthinking sent something embarrassing inappropriate somebody even though know didnt know worth overthinking eventually ill leave never see people brain doesnt accept answer anybody tips calm really want vent friends theyre always taking everything jokingly dont feel comfortable opening thats vent strangers reddit

1j8k9g4,2025-03-11 11:41:37,Sorry if this is a trauma dump. Just a question. Feel free to move along if too long🙂,"Am I the only one who wants the strength to end it all? I am afraid to die because of what is or isn’t on the other side. I have done some bad stuff in my life, I’ve never harmed anyone, I used to be a Pastor but lost my faith for awhile. Not sure where it is right now. I desperately want to believe like I used to but “looking behind the curtain” of church politics killed my faith. I do believe in Jesus but now I worry that God is just waiting for me to die to punish me. I know it sounds stupid but it’s where I am at. 

My mother, brother and great grandfather all committed suicide. My mother and brother was all I had in this world. My brother was my hero and best friend. It sounds like a tragic movie but the last time we saw each other we got into a huge fight. We used to talk everyday but after the fight we didn’t talk for months. My mom begged me to call him because she was worried but my anger stopped me. He did not commit suicide because of it, he lost his wife, kids and job, but I failed him. I have daily nightmares over it, they never stop, always the same. I watch him die over and over. I’m tired of waking up either sweating or yelling about it. 

My mom left about a year later, she couldn’t handle the pain. I used to hate them for it but lately I wonder if they were the strong ones instead of me. 

Our father was extremely abusive growing up and left when I was 8. It messed us all up. I have seen multiple psychiatrists but they all warn me that if I say I want to harm myself they will hospitalize me. I have a loving wife but we joke that she is “allergic” to weakness. I guess you can call me a “man’s man”. I played football, and coached for 30 years. I used to be very athletic and fearless. I’m on 4 Klonopins a day but feel no relief. Talking is a waste of money and time. I have a chronic and progressive muscle disease with relentless pain and extreme acid reflux. I refuse pain meds because both my mother and brother were addicted to them. Surgery is not an option for my Gerd due to the disease. I barely eat, cannot drink or use cannabis due to dyspepsia and Gerd. I lost hope a long time ago. I wonder if I’m just delaying the inevitable. I wonder if the fear will wear off. 

I believe it’s possible to be two things at once. You can be afraid or death but not excited to live. Am I the only one afraid of God? That is my question. Thank you 🙂

It got to a point where I couldn't even ATTEMPT to do what I was nervous about because I would become so sick (first dates, job interviews, amusement park visits--stuff I was actually excited about). 

As a kid, this would always leave me very confused and angry at myself.  My entire life, I dealt with the cycle of getting excited about something, becoming so ill I couldn't safely do it anymore, and being really upset at myself for not ""pushing through."" 

But after I turned 19, my emotional response to anxiety attacks kind of changed. I guess I realized my anxiety was something I never had control over, and there wasn't anything wrong or bad about me as a person for feeling how I felt. I was able to separate my anxiety from my own self-worth so I could get pissed off at IT. This was before I had a therapist or any of my formal diagnoses as well (generalized anxiety, ADHD, and autism). 

I can hear an intrusive thought in my head and be like ""Um. Shut the fuck up?"" When I start feeling sick, I don't blame myself for the chemicals in my brain making me feel bad. I blame the little guy that's fucking my shit up in there. 

It doesn't make the anxiety totally go away. I still experience the onset of anxiety, and it's still hard. But it always helps. Does anyone else have experience with this?

Idk how I can put on a fake happy face to work when I feel so depressed. I don't have many other job options where I live and I can't drive myself yet(working on license.) The past few shifts, as a trainer, you are supposed to tell your co-workers to clean something when it's not busy and like correct them when taking orders, etc. I find that people don't listen to me at all, or they just can't hear me because I'm quiet, but I make the effort to speak a little louder when I'm telling them to do something. It just feels so upsetting to not be heard, and also the fact that I'm not social at all so I'm mostly observing and watching everyone else socialize while I'm the only one actually doing the job and paying attention. I don't like a lot of my coworkers and it's energy depleting to be around them. I can't connect with people the same way they do.

1j8cyvz,2025-03-11 05:06:26,Am I delusional or wrong?,"Hello, I don't know the right tag for this. I'm just so tired. Everything makes me sick. I'm from a society who is really closed on mental health issues. Sometimes I think I'm going insane but I don't know why I hold on anymore actually. My mother and brother is very mean, is probably the root to most of my issues. I have a very loving boyfriend who cares for me in the absolute best way possible, sometimes I think he's the reason why I am here. I can't really say everything here as to why my family is the issue but I hope some of these occasions sum it up a little. 

> Once when I was having a terrible panic attack, being hysterical and hyperventilating. My brother (who lives abroad for his studies) was on call, (I was in that position because of an argument with my mom and brother), starts saying to me after I calmed down the following 

Brother: ""Are you realising that you're hyperventilating?"" 
Me: ""Yes, I have anxiety I've been telling you since 4 years ago, it just got bad""
Brother: ""If you're gonna be like this things won't work out, how are you meant to also move abroad and study then?"" 
Me: ""Ill manage, I want to go study abroad""
Brother: ""No if you have anxiety then you can't do anything here there's no point to you coming here abroad then"" 
Me: ""Ill worry about that but I can manage I'll be ok it'll go away"" 
Brother: ""No there's no benefit in her coming here (talking to mom)"" 
Mom: ""Yeah she needs to understand that she can't deal with things abroad if she's like this"" 

This was a bit of the conversation and ofcourse it's translated from my language to English so it sounds much better. But imagine the tone to be the most talking down tone ever referring to me technically just being worthless and useless and not a worthwhile investment to make (sending me abroad to study and work). 

I finally got medicine for my anxiety from a doctor because one panic attack was so terrible I had muscle spasms and though I was dying because my hands and legs started twisting because of which I had to get admitted to the hospital and mom HAD to take me to the doctor because I was dizzy all the time from severe stress (multiple deaths in the family). After the doctor prescribed medicine one of them was making me have terrible nightmares every night from which I used to scream and wake up and my mother always blamed it on the fact that I stayed up late at night and just played games but that aside. It was being caused by a beta blocker I was prescribed so the dosage of that was decreased to help but in between that another occasion for better understanding.

> Another call with brother 
Mom: ""Yeah she keeps screaming and her dosage was lowered (on call with brother)"" 
Brother: ""Tell her to show me what medicine she takes"" 
Me: ""Gave him the prescription""
Brother: ""IS THE DOCTOR STUPID? WHY WOULD HE GIVE YOU A BETA BLOCKER? IS HE EVEN QUALIFIED TO BE A DOCTOR? YOURE NOT AT THE AGE TO CONSUME THESE!  (I'm 21)"" 
Me: ""Its because of severe stress and the medicine helps after being adjusted I'm not dizzy anymore"" 
Brother: ""Do you think you're at the age to be creating these problems right now? You're supposed to come here abroad to study, why on earth are you stressed? Do we deny you of anything (mom and him)? Don't we give you enough? Why do you cause these issues?"" 
Me: ""Ill be ok don't worry, I'll deal with it"" 

And another short story 

>My boyfriend recommended me to take 1mg melatonin supplements to help me with my sleep so I took those and they helped but once my brother found out, he called my boyfriend illiterate and horrible things because apparently melatonin supplements are addictive and he got his girlfriend off of them or something and forced her to sleep normally and some other stuff. When I take them just fine whenever I need to and stop whenever I need to. 

Today's story which pushed me to writing this 

>My mom has been sick for a month and we've been in and out of the hospital and it's Ramadan right now (I'm Muslim) so fasting is also a thing right now. Also I got into a university abroad and paid my fees and got my visa however I am applying to cancel it and get a refund as her health isn't so well and I have to look after her since my brother isn't here and we don't have a dad anymore. I voluntarily said I'd stay here in our home country and look after our mother and get admitted in a university here to take care of things. After which she also berated me saying ""I wasted time and money on this entire process"". That's a whole another story which idk might vent if people care to hear even. I don't think anyone read upto this point even, but if you did, thank you, I guess atleast you care about me. 

So, 1 month she's sick and I've been doing things here and there to help except cooking because I cant. And even if I made food, it's not stuff she can eat or likes suppose pasta. So I called my cousin and her husband over to stay a few days. They have been here for 3 days and helped with cooking. 

>Everyone went to bed since they'd wakeup at 3:30 AM to have suhoor (dinner before starting fast) and I as always stayed up playing games with my boyfriend online. Everyday for the past month I've been constantly checking up on my mom about two to three times while she sleeps just gently checking if she has a fever or not and if she is awake asking her if she needs any food or water or anything at all. And today, me and my boyfriend just so happened to be arguing and well my door was closed like usual and my phone was unfortunately on silent because I forgot to unsilence it after the doctor visit earlier today. My mom called out for me for water but I didn't hear and my phone didn't ring when she called. My cousin's husband is heavily sleeping and my cousin is too so I suppose she got up and was dizzy and got the water herself then came banging my door. I opened and asked her what happened concerned why she's up. And here is our conversation. 
Mom: ""I called you so many times and I've been yelling did you not hear me?"" 
Me: ""No I'm sorry what happened what do you need?"" 
Mom: ""Oh I need nothing no problem I just wanted some water but I guess that's not possible since I'm irrelevant and it's okay. Even if I die don't bother coming when I call you"" (most asian parent ofcourse typical line) 
Me: ""Im sorry I made a mistake I didn't realise it was past the time I check on you everyday I'm sorry do you still need anything?"" 
Mom: -starts stomping away- 
Me: ""Whats wrong I said I'm sorry I didn't realise phone was on silent""
Mom: ""Why should it be on silent? Don't you care about me? Don't you remember to unsilence it?"" 
Me: ""Look I'm sorry I made a mistake it won't happen again and don't I come to check on you everyday? I'm sorry today I failed""
Mom: ""Just because you check up on me 1 day doesn't mean you get a free pass for everyday"" 
Me: obviously stunned ""1 day? I've been checking on you for a month or more and I will be I'm just sorry it happened today"" 
Mom: ""Ok go"" 

And well then she proceeded to complain to my cousin who woke up saying I stay up late and I'm careless and I don't listen to her and when I went and asked her what's wrong with her and if I actually am that careless she said bunch of other things then started using the ""Im sick you're making it worse"" excuse and my cousin started telling me to be nicer and calmer and listen to her better and never do the same mistake or even give my mom the chance to blame me for such a mistake. 

I thought these would be short but here we are, I'm sorry if any of you read it and found it difficult. Idk sometimes the way everyone just convinces me to care for my sick mother and how she's a mom so she can say things at times makes me believe that I'm probably insane and overreacting. But I do question too that am I really not supposed to be hurt right now? 

Thank you for reading, I hope you have a good day and never ever live to experience my days or even something similar. Because I'm tired.

1j84blu,2025-03-10 23:04:41,I am the most anxious in my own home.,"EDIT: I will not be going back to fix the spelling mistakes. Reading this makes me uncomfortable. Will delete later. Just let me feel like I opened up before i shut myself back in again.

I don't understand what it is.

I've always been pretty paranoid, whenever I'm home alone, I am convinced that there is somebody walking around, eating the food, opening doors, etc. 
I have to check the entire house before I can feel calm, and still I remain convinced there is somebody there. 

However, the worst part of staying at home isn't when I am alone.
My family makes my anxiety worse by simply existing.

I have two lamps in my room, which keep the atmosphere dim lit and calm. My sister wears perscription glasses and insists on having the horribly bright, interrogation scene worthy, center light on each time she enters the room. A sense of dread washes over me each time and I cannot explain how gross the blearing light makes me feel. I cannot be calm. I try to put my head under the blanket but I keep running out of air, and it gets exceptionally hot in there! I understand that she needs it and that she cannot see her schoolwork or phone well in the dark, but it is a constant fight for who gets the light. If it were up to her, we'd sleep with ghat ugly light on.

The next is quite ridiculous, and I don't understand why it irks me so much.
This man has never hurt me beyond verbally insulting me, which I excused as a large generational gap issue. He means well despite his short fuse, I am sure of it, however, I dread it whenever he speaks to me because the man has never learned the concept of the words ""I do not want to do that."" (Usually in reference to him demanding I socialize)\
My father is a heavy set man. Whenever he walks his footsteps echo across the hollow floors and I am not joking when I say, my whole head feels like it vibrates with each step he takes. The force of his feet on the ground makes the unshed tears in my lacrimal glands shiver like they are waves in the ocean during a small earthquake. The way he casually slams doors leaves me feeling numb. I cannot be calm.
I pray every time his footsteps pass my door that he isn't coming in to talk to me, and I dread his knocking, or lack there of. The sound of the plastic door handle going ""ch"" whenever he opens the door in his specific rough way is etched into my brain like a nightmare that just won't go away.
He keeps the TV on very loud which is one of the reasons I don't leave my room often, though I don't begrudge him for that because he is infact partially deaf.

My brother is going through puberty and just has a very loud voice which is still developing some of those deeper undertones. I do not like his voice. It is too deep, too loud, too strange. I dislike speaking with him or being in the room when he speaks. He never says kind words to me. But then again, neither do I to him anymore.
That is fine. I don't care about what he does. He's never at home anyway.
Our parents tell him to bother me in my room because he's more extroverted than I am. They want me to listen to him about how he makes friends and why. Which is stupid, he's a 15 yearold who has adopted the ability of mansplaining to a T. 
I don't need a man to tell me how to make friends.
People overwhelm me and I will go about forging meaningful or superficial relationships at my own pace.

My mother has no respect for herself which makes me angry. 
By far what makes me the angriest is when she is yelling at the walls, which is often, complaining about something someone, either one of my siblings or I or even a complete stranger, has done. She won't shut up. I know it is rude to say so, she is my mother, but she does. Not. Have. An. Off. Button!!!
She is the type of person who bottles down her emotions in public, but once she is at home she lets the negative energy explode. Everything annoys her. Everything is an issue. In a way I am like her. I hate that about us.
She'll talk to herself for hours. I will have music blearing in my earphones at dangerously high altitude while shut in my room and I will still hear her. (And still calling my room feels wrong. It isn't mine. It never was mine. It's more my sisters than it was mine. The whole house isn't mine. Our parents remind us every day we live under their roof, so i cannot call this room i've been graciously given just for it to be taken away the moment i hopefully move out, mine. Which seems ungrateful and ut is.) Just as I think that I've calmed down finally, that I've acheived some state of tranquility, cocooned up in my dimly lit room, brain neurons dancing to a boppy-yet-repetative-enough-that-it-could-be-tuned-out song the music slows down, that dreadful period of the last few seconds as song a switches to song a again, because you bet i've got that shit on repeat, I can still f***ing hear her yelling and squealing and crying in the living room because the walls are too thin and the doors are too old and her vocal coards are too loud! It never fails to make me wish the song would just loop and loop at it's loudest without ever leaving room for a thought. 

The way back home from school is just uncomfortable. One one hand, I hate walking to school, especially while the sun is still up, I hate being outside, I hate oveethinking. On the other hand the moment I leave school, the moment my feet hit those stairs leading down to the entrence, I don't want to go home. I just want to keep walking, and walking until it's so dark outside that I can't see my own nose in front of me, and then I want to keep walking on more, and I dkn't want yo encounter a single person, a single predator, I just want wastelands of dark, dimly lit roads with no cars ever passing close enough by me to freak me out, to disturb the peace, to be to loud.
Better yet I just want to stay in school, prop my backpack on the floor, cuddle up underneath a desk and sleep there until the bell rings for the firat class next morning.
Realistically speaking that would make me more anxious than actually going home, but in that moment I could just lock myself in the school bathroom on a whim and hide there until closing. That is how strong my anxiety is.

The worst part of all is that my family has never done anything bad to me. I just cannot stand their habbits. My mother knocked on the door just now, her signature rapid finger knock, the kind that makes the hairs on your neck stand up. Maybe it's the fact that the center light is on, the fact that my stomach is already upset and my insides feel like they are on fire because I have an asignament due tomorrow which I have not begun.

I just want to be normal. I want this to stop. My head feels too heavy. My facial expresions are just so wrong, my mouth feels like it does and says whatever the fuck an alternative version of some alien dimension of myself is wanting it to do. My head is filled with clay, and that clay has reached a melting point because its dripping down into my a breathing tubes and eating tubes and whatever fucking tubes there are left. My throat feels as though I swallowed a potatoe pealer and the skin it expectedly grated is floating about in my stomach acid, like a lump, like a d**n lump! I fucking hate all of it. All of it. Stop it. I just want stop it . Jsut stop it. Just stop it. I can't do anything. I can't. I HAVE NO BRAIN anymore, I have no concept of thpught, I HAVE NO LUNGS I can't do this. I CAN'T. I CAN'T WRITE ANYMORE i just cant. And i'm tearing uo and i can't i can't. Help me,  please. Please. I can't help 

myself.
I am worong, i am wrong, and.
And i don't know how i am wrong i just know that i am wrong. I can't fucking breathe, FUck.

I don't have the words I do not. I just want to scream. I just want to scream. But I can't even scream because I'm not alone in the house. I want to scream. And repeating the wors I just want to scream, i want to scream i want to scream, i want to scream, is making me feel better and i'm sorry for being repetative, i just want to scream. I want to scream. I have no air no air. My instinctive reaction is to hold my breath and i jsut , it just wont come out. The air wont come out and i cant scream i cant breathe, my lungs inflate and they ache my chest and i could be bleeding internally i just cannot scream. I want to scream.

I am treating this like a diary. Wriying helps me stay calm. Repeating phrases helps me stay calm, saty calm, stay calm calm calm. I like being calm. Even if it only lasts for a few long seconds at most. EDIT: Stupid. Who doesn't like being f***ing calm.

The title says it all, i sometimes feel like i’m naked even when i’m fully clothed. i get this wave of uncomfortableness, kind of as if i was seasick or if i ate something bad, in my heart and it lingers. the best way i could describe this is i feel like i’m suddenly naked even though i’m not. and i don’t think that i feel exposed or anything its never been about that (at least im pretty sure but maybe it is) its just very strange and i feel this at random times. i have a little bit of self consciousness but not so much that’s its always overwhelming and there. i have a lot of anxiety but it never felt like it was about that. maybe it is and that’s why i’m posting it on here. it doesn’t make me feel anxious, it just makes me feel sad and weird. it feels very uncomfortable, like i want to disappear and like no one can see me, but at the same time, they can see everything i’m feeling. its very weird. i’ve felt this after changing, when i’m not wearing a bra, in front of family and sometimes just randomly. i’ve never been abused or anything, either. so idk what else it could be. nothing feels right, no “answer” feels like the right one and idk if i’m the only one who this happens to. 

please let me know and if anyone has any answers or thoughts, or if anyone has felt that way too, it would be very very helpful.

1j8eyu6,2025-03-11 06:41:29,How can I get over my fear of rejection?,"In high school, I was best friends with this girl. We were inseparable, with the same friend group. We fell out aggressively, with a fight blowing out that hurt us both pretty badly. Additionnally, the group decided to cut me off. That is perhaps fair, I don't blame them as I was an angry kid and dealt with my anger in really mean ways. I did not know how to communicate effectively and had a habit of getting irritated very easily. Also, this may not seem as important or could relate to my own vanity but I was an ugly and fat kid. They were all fairly good looking, and I realized in later years that part of my anger actually stuck to that (The nicest compliment I received from one of them was ""you don't look bad"", and one of the friends in the group once spent an entire day referring to me as a whale.) When the fallout happened, I lost almost all friendships in that group except the one girl who was truly supportive towards me.

Then, over the last two years after the fallout, I've struggled with severe anxiety that has actively stopped me from interacting with people. It started off as crippling, reaching a degree where I couldn't even say hello without having a panic attack. Now, it's slightly better. I sweat profusely when interacting with anyone and stutter dramatically, for example running into a girl I went to elementary school with and not knowing how to hold a conversation longer than a minute. I tend to keep to myself now, and for a minute I was convinced that everything was better alone.

Now, I want to have a more social life. I have a boyfriend, who is lovely, but I'd like to have more than one friend. I realize this is somewhat vain but I love the idea of having people to connect with.

Although recently, I was found with a possibility of finding myself in the same hangout as the girl who I had a fallout with and my anxiety tripled. Last night, I had a nightmare about it. I dreamt that I ran into her and a girl I knew in a class of mine, and I decided to initiate a conversation. I asked her how she was doing and she simply shut me down, and the girl who shared my class followed along. This led me to the realisation that perhaps I am terrified of being rejected the same way I was rejected by an entire group.

What can I do to get over this possible fear of getting rejected?

1j8egyx,2025-03-11 06:17:46,Are these anxiety symptoms?,"Hi! First time posting on Reddit. Ever since a few weeks ago, I've been unable to eat the normal amount of food I usually can. I'd be halfway through my typical meal when suddenly I'd find myself unable to eat anymore. I would still be hungry, but my mouth and throat would react as if I were completely full, and I'd just spit everything out to avoid gagging.

Eventually, this escalated to a point where I wasn't able to eat any food at all, not even crumbs. I couldn't drink water for a day. I couldn't even brush my teeth because I went into a panic whenever anything was inside my mouth. I'd spend all my time awake focusing on my breathing and fighting the feeling of nausea alongside the terrible tight feeling in my throat with my heart pounding. This has gotten much less severe as some days passed, but I still struggle to eat more than a handful of food throughout the whole day on average. It's a fight getting any food down, and if I eat too much I become nauseous and panicked for hours. I am always hungry.

It's only been a few weeks, but this has made me really upset. I've lost some weight and now I'm under 100 pounds for the first time in my life since middle school. I've found myself struggling to study and focus properly, which isn't great considering that I have exams coming up soon and I'll need to be in class to take them, but the thought of going to school physically distresses me. I tried going to class today, but right before I was about to leave I could feel a lump in my throat, and my throat began to tighten and my heart began to race and I was on the verge of tears. I really want to go to class, but I guess I just can't.

Does anyone else experience symptoms like these? I'm not completely sure what I'm going through right now, but a lot of people are telling me it's anxiety. I've always had social anxiety and been prone to feeling quite anxious, but it was never like this. I'm also taking hydroxyzine, as prescribed by my doctor, but I'm not sure if it's done much.

I was diagnosed with anxiety, severe PTSD, and depression. 

Here lately it has got worse. More bad days than good days. He thankfully doesn’t have to deal with these mental illnesses. I feel like I have become too much and a burden. He try’s his best to comfort me and be there for me. I have sat down and talked to him about the extremities of why it is so bad, and sometimes I have random panic attacks come on that I can’t even explain because I don’t know why it happened. 

I understand he wants happy days and I’m his girlfriend so my pain and moods reflect onto him. I’m trying really hard. I don’t want to lose him. This is my longest relationship I have ever been in. I see a bright future with him ending in marriage. He gave me a promise ring which he’s never done before to any girl. He even took something sacred of mine because of my SA I was so scared to even do anything and I opened him with warm arms because I know how much he loved me and planned on being there for me.

1j8dnoj,2025-03-11 05:38:27,Trintellix 10mg not working,"I was on Lexapro 20mg for several years without experiencing any side effects. However, over the past year, I noticed my anxiety creeping back, and I started relying more on my clonazepam. After discussing this with my doctor, we decided to switch me from Lexapro to Trintellix (10mg), and I’ve now been on it for over three months. My doctor was very positive about Trintellix and its benefits, but honestly, I feel worse on it than I did on Lexapro. I’ve never experienced side effects before, but now I’m dealing with headaches and nausea. Most frustratingly, my anxiety is still there, and I continue to rely on clonazepam.

We tried increasing the dose to 15mg, but the nausea became unbearable, so I went back to 10mg. Before switching medications, my doctor mentioned adding a low dose of Seroquel or Abilify, but I’ve been hesitant because my brother had a very negative reaction to them. I really would prefer to find an antidepressant that can help with my anxiety without adding another medication.

I’m also in therapy, so I’m managing, but it’s exhausting to still feel this way when I’m on a medication that should be helping. I have an appointment with my doctor this Thursday and would appreciate any feedback or recommendations from people who might understand where I’m coming from.

1j8cz1h,2025-03-11 05:06:40,Am I delusional or wrong?,"Hello, I don't know the right tag for this. I'm just so tired. Everything makes me sick. I'm from a society who is really closed on mental health issues. Sometimes I think I'm going insane but I don't know why I hold on anymore actually. My mother and brother is very mean, is probably the root to most of my issues. I have a very loving boyfriend who cares for me in the absolute best way possible, sometimes I think he's the reason why I am here. I can't really say everything here as to why my family is the issue but I hope some of these occasions sum it up a little. 

> Once when I was having a terrible panic attack, being hysterical and hyperventilating. My brother (who lives abroad for his studies) was on call, (I was in that position because of an argument with my mom and brother), starts saying to me after I calmed down the following 

Brother: ""Are you realising that you're hyperventilating?"" 
Me: ""Yes, I have anxiety I've been telling you since 4 years ago, it just got bad""
Brother: ""If you're gonna be like this things won't work out, how are you meant to also move abroad and study then?"" 
Me: ""Ill manage, I want to go study abroad""
Brother: ""No if you have anxiety then you can't do anything here there's no point to you coming here abroad then"" 
Me: ""Ill worry about that but I can manage I'll be ok it'll go away"" 
Brother: ""No there's no benefit in her coming here (talking to mom)"" 
Mom: ""Yeah she needs to understand that she can't deal with things abroad if she's like this"" 

This was a bit of the conversation and ofcourse it's translated from my language to English so it sounds much better. But imagine the tone to be the most talking down tone ever referring to me technically just being worthless and useless and not a worthwhile investment to make (sending me abroad to study and work). 

I finally got medicine for my anxiety from a doctor because one panic attack was so terrible I had muscle spasms and though I was dying because my hands and legs started twisting because of which I had to get admitted to the hospital and mom HAD to take me to the doctor because I was dizzy all the time from severe stress (multiple deaths in the family). After the doctor prescribed medicine one of them was making me have terrible nightmares every night from which I used to scream and wake up and my mother always blamed it on the fact that I stayed up late at night and just played games but that aside. It was being caused by a beta blocker I was prescribed so the dosage of that was decreased to help but in between that another occasion for better understanding.

> Another call with brother 
Mom: ""Yeah she keeps screaming and her dosage was lowered (on call with brother)"" 
Brother: ""Tell her to show me what medicine she takes"" 
Me: ""Gave him the prescription""
Brother: ""IS THE DOCTOR STUPID? WHY WOULD HE GIVE YOU A BETA BLOCKER? IS HE EVEN QUALIFIED TO BE A DOCTOR? YOURE NOT AT THE AGE TO CONSUME THESE!  (I'm 21)"" 
Me: ""Its because of severe stress and the medicine helps after being adjusted I'm not dizzy anymore"" 
Brother: ""Do you think you're at the age to be creating these problems right now? You're supposed to come here abroad to study, why on earth are you stressed? Do we deny you of anything (mom and him)? Don't we give you enough? Why do you cause these issues?"" 
Me: ""Ill be ok don't worry, I'll deal with it"" 

And another short story 

>My boyfriend recommended me to take 1mg melatonin supplements to help me with my sleep so I took those and they helped but once my brother found out, he called my boyfriend illiterate and horrible things because apparently melatonin supplements are addictive and he got his girlfriend off of them or something and forced her to sleep normally and some other stuff. When I take them just fine whenever I need to and stop whenever I need to. 

Today's story which pushed me to writing this 

>My mom has been sick for a month and we've been in and out of the hospital and it's Ramadan right now (I'm Muslim) so fasting is also a thing right now. Also I got into a university abroad and paid my fees and got my visa however I am applying to cancel it and get a refund as her health isn't so well and I have to look after her since my brother isn't here and we don't have a dad anymore. I voluntarily said I'd stay here in our home country and look after our mother and get admitted in a university here to take care of things. After which she also berated me saying ""I wasted time and money on this entire process"". That's a whole another story which idk might vent if people care to hear even. I don't think anyone read upto this point even, but if you did, thank you, I guess atleast you care about me. 

So, 1 month she's sick and I've been doing things here and there to help except cooking because I cant. And even if I made food, it's not stuff she can eat or likes suppose pasta. So I called my cousin and her husband over to stay a few days. They have been here for 3 days and helped with cooking. 

>Everyone went to bed since they'd wakeup at 3:30 AM to have suhoor (dinner before starting fast) and I as always stayed up playing games with my boyfriend online. Everyday for the past month I've been constantly checking up on my mom about two to three times while she sleeps just gently checking if she has a fever or not and if she is awake asking her if she needs any food or water or anything at all. And today, me and my boyfriend just so happened to be arguing and well my door was closed like usual and my phone was unfortunately on silent because I forgot to unsilence it after the doctor visit earlier today. My mom called out for me for water but I didn't hear and my phone didn't ring when she called. My cousin's husband is heavily sleeping and my cousin is too so I suppose she got up and was dizzy and got the water herself then came banging my door. I opened and asked her what happened concerned why she's up. And here is our conversation. 
Mom: ""I called you so many times and I've been yelling did you not hear me?"" 
Me: ""No I'm sorry what happened what do you need?"" 
Mom: ""Oh I need nothing no problem I just wanted some water but I guess that's not possible since I'm irrelevant and it's okay. Even if I die don't bother coming when I call you"" (most asian parent ofcourse typical line) 
Me: ""Im sorry I made a mistake I didn't realise it was past the time I check on you everyday I'm sorry do you still need anything?"" 
Mom: -starts stomping away- 
Me: ""Whats wrong I said I'm sorry I didn't realise phone was on silent""
Mom: ""Why should it be on silent? Don't you care about me? Don't you remember to unsilence it?"" 
Me: ""Look I'm sorry I made a mistake it won't happen again and don't I come to check on you everyday? I'm sorry today I failed""
Mom: ""Just because you check up on me 1 day doesn't mean you get a free pass for everyday"" 
Me: obviously stunned ""1 day? I've been checking on you for a month or more and I will be I'm just sorry it happened today"" 
Mom: ""Ok go"" 

And well then she proceeded to complain to my cousin who woke up saying I stay up late and I'm careless and I don't listen to her and when I went and asked her what's wrong with her and if I actually am that careless she said bunch of other things then started using the ""Im sick you're making it worse"" excuse and my cousin started telling me to be nicer and calmer and listen to her better and never do the same mistake or even give my mom the chance to blame me for such a mistake. 

I thought these would be short but here we are, I'm sorry if any of you read it and found it difficult. Idk sometimes the way everyone just convinces me to care for my sick mother and how she's a mom so she can say things at times makes me believe that I'm probably insane and overreacting. But I do question too that am I really not supposed to be hurt right now? 

Thank you for reading, I hope you have a good day and never ever live to experience my days or even something similar. Because I'm tired.

1j8480y,2025-03-10 23:00:37,Anxiety Bladder,"I’m a 30yo female, and it’s almost coming to a year where I’ve been dealing with anxiety and the urge to pee that comes with it. 

It first started when I was waiting in a long line for something and I had to use the bathroom but I didn’t want to lose my place. Once I was done the urge hit me like a train and I RAN to the nearest bathroom, in fear I would wet myself in front of people. Since then, this issue would be reoccurring. 

Places like the movies, Uber rides, airports, planes, even a room full of crowded people, the urge would come and when I did go to relieve myself nothing ever really came out. I’ve had my fair share of horrible experiences on a flight and on trips. I almost considered just never leaving my home again, which is where I felt the most safe.

About 5 months ago I decided to seek therapy, which actually helped me a lot. Before meeting with him I was prescribed antidepressants and Ativan by my regular doctor. I did start the medication but stopped once I began meeting my therapist who taught me breathing exercises to relax my muscles and specifically my bladder. He also taught me how to be more graceful with my thoughts. For instance, instead of overthinking I might pee my pants in public, I should be more productive with my thoughts and that’s what I did. I would prepare myself with things that can distract me if I’m on a plane, maybe use women sanitary products for protection just in case, I would avoid caffeine and alcohol if I’m out in public, and a huge thing which I’m still learning to do but has worked many times is remind myself I never have peed my pants even at my worst. Basically, you have to train your mind that it’s gonna be all okay. 

I still have anxiety in certain places and doing certain things, but I can say I have managed it a lot better than the past - it also doesn’t hit me like a train like it used to. I also try not to avoid avoiding because it will only get worse. You really have to put yourself out there and battle your thoughts. It also doesn’t hurt to prepare yourself physically and mentally if you are going out. I think about my anxiety and the urge to pee EVERYDAY, but in a way that’s me just preparing for it.

Do I wish I never had this issue? Of course. It’s still here and I don’t know if it will ever go away, but I am seeing some progress. I can say reducing caffeine and alcohol has helped extremely. I also enjoy audiobooks that help with relaxation and anxiety. You really just have to seek what works for you and don’t be too hard on yourself.

1j8453d,2025-03-10 22:57:18,Anybody wants to talk about anxiety- ocd episodes?,"Hello guys!

I have been reading the threads for long time now and they have been really helpful,  but I have always been too shy to post.

During the past two weeks I have been in a massive anxiety-ocd crisis and although I have been there before and successfully overcame it, every time it happens it hits hard. 

The idea of sharing my experience though and connect with people in similar situations is really comforting and helpful.
So here I am, getting the courage of doing so:

A couple of weeks ago,  my husband and mysel got really sick with the flu including high fever for more than five days etc. At the same time we were in the middle of moving apartments, so lots of organisation and other similar kind of tasks had to be done either while being sick or had to be squized within a limited amount of time. Forgot to mention that deadlines at work were just kept going...

As I have been anxiety-ocd episodes free for two years now while also being on zoloft for the first time in my life, I thought that no big crisis would happen again (at least not soon).

But, here i am two weeks now in a spiral of cprippling anxiety which started with a massive panick attack over my health situation (although I am now fully recovered from the flu and reassured by my doc that all is fine).
The two weeks passed can be summarised as follows:
- massive panick attack while trying to buy grosseries for the new flat.
- two days after that, constant panick state , also visited the ER for high heartbeat but reassured me all was ok with my heart and prescribed xanax.
- ocd intrusive thinking joined the ""party"" with fear of going insane and excessive research as reassuring.
- small feelings of detachment due to big anxiety triggered more anxiety and.
- started cbt therapy 😀 and doc increased a bit my zoloft dosage
- days were difficult to manage work-wise but also other daily tasks
- ocd switching topics, so basically the mind was just trying to find a new fear available

Thankfully, the evenings have always been better, calmer and way more functioning in comparison to the mornings. It almost feels that my anxiety has a time-limitation and gets much friendlier during the night when I get my appetite back as well and can finally catch a breath 🌙 

Today is the start of the third week in anxiety and started feeling better. Still long way to go though, but I guess baby- steps are still a small win. The issue with myself is that i wanted it to pass immediate or the sonnet possibe which results in quite the opposite.

Just sending lots of hugs and courage around to anyone at the same or similar situation as mine. We will get through this !

Glad it anyone wants to talk or share as well!

Have a good evening everyone!

1j84174,2025-03-10 22:52:55,Sick of the return of my anxiety,"Just a quick rant, but I've had terrible anxiety since the end of high school that seemingly went away during my first years of college. Then, it returned full force to the point I couldn't leave the house or drive without slowly starting to panic for no reason. After about a year, it seemed to dissipate away on its own and for the longest while I felt 90% normal. I could socialize, drive to other states, go to appointments, get my haircuts, and much more without feeling fear or the impending symptoms of panic attacks.

  
Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I knew that whenever I exercised too hard too fast I would get so breathless that it throws me into a near-panic attack. I've been able to stop it each time and continue with my exercise just fine in the past. But now, it actually spiraled into a full blown one where I felt like I wasn't getting enough air and panicked so badly, my face was pale in the mirror. Later that evening when I went to the store, I suddenly felt that familiar anxiety while driving, and in public I felt like I wasn't ""all there"" anymore. It's suddenly very difficult to focus again and it's just like how it was a few years back. I'm so angry that a simple workout re-awakened my anxiety and panic, because I feel like the one thing that could help me suppress anxiety again is being blocked BY anxiety. 

  
I'm slowly trying to do things step-by-step that usually make me anxious/panicky (driving, exercise, socializing), but I'm just hoping I don't screw it up and send myself back into that pit. I would say for the first week after that attack, I was constantly at a 7 or 8 out of 10. But as of today, I normally average at about a 3 or 4. On the road or exercising varies, but it hasn't really gotten to how it was the week I panicked. 



I rode my bike today for maybe 20 minutes to acclimate myself to it again and almost panicked just once. It was like a tug of war where I took a deep breath and held it for a bit, and stopped thinking. But that quickly went away because I see scenarios in my head during anxiety episodes ""Why don't I go to a nearby house and ask for help? What if I jumped off my bike now and caught my breath? I need to turn around now, I won't make it!"". Still though, I held on and remembered for a brief moment those times I've felt this near-panic before all of this constant anxiety and being able to shut it up. For some reason, that quelled the panic a considerable amount. I made a few more laps and returned home.



My body just doesn't ease into the exercise it feels like, but I think it's because my heart is already pounding out of my chest the moment I get on my bike. The added exercise just raises my heart rate more and my breathing is likely not sufficient for what's going on so I hyperventilate. 



As I write this, I feel like I'm starting to understand more about this trigger, but the matter becomes - how do I just tell my brain to stop making my heart beat out of my chest before I'm even on the bike? I feel like it's always anticipation that really destroys me. The anticipation of going onto the highway while driving, the anticipation of going to an event later in the week, the anticipation of a breathless workout, the anticipation of panic. If it wasn't for the fear that accumulates *because* of anticipation, I wouldn't be having this anxiety at all!

  
It's honestly so frustrating knowing I could do all of these normal things for years, and now suddenly I'm debilitated once again. If I try to force myself, I just panic and my mindset becomes ""I want to go home, I want to be in bed, or at my desk, somewhere safe and calming"". Sometimes without thinking, once I've finished something that makes me anxious and I drive home, my brain immediately goes ""It's OK we're going home now, we'll be alright"". Super frustrating. For the vacations I planned out this year, I suddenly find no interest in going anymore because of the whole ""being away from my safe home"". I feel like I've slowly felt more comfortable going to local places though, so I'm glad I'm not fully gone. If this continues, I feel like I'll really need medication to control all of this.

1j816nm,2025-03-10 20:55:29,8 years of Health Anxiety,"I'm writing this post as I really don't know what else to do - I know the correct answer is: ""go to the doctors, get tested"" - but believe me I can't. 

(27 F)

It all started nearly 8 years ago , when I made the worst mistake of my life. I was at University, desperate for some validation off boys, and stupidly had a one night stand (unprotected) with a guy I had met. We only saw each other the once, as he ended up getting back with his ex. Anyway, around two weeks later, I found out that I had Chlamydia. I was treated for this, and I was supposed to go back in a few weeks, to do a further check up. However, I found the whole thing to be really traumatic. I was only 20, and I dealt with it on my own. I was so scared, and I felt so ashamed and blindsided by it all - so I never went back to clinic.

I told myself to just ignore it all, and move on with my life. It's common, it happens to lots of people. That was until I got a yeast infection a short while later. I looked into it, and saw that it was a common symptom of HIV in women. And this is when I spiralled, which continued to only get worse, as the yeast infections became recurrent.  

There have been **so** many things over the years that have come up over the years - and anything that happens to my body, my mind instantly goes to HIV. It then sends me into an almighty panic - the kind that makes me sweat and cry, and feel like the world is closing in on me.

I don't know how I can keep living my life like this. But the alternate is even more terrifying. I so badly want to be free of this, but the fear I have around this, is utterly paralysing. I can't even allow myself to comprehend the thought of having to go through testing or to speak to someone about it. I have tried talking with Doctors, therapists and CBT councillors, but I have never told them the whole truth. And so I just suffer in silence with it. I ended up going on medication to try and numb myself to it, but that only worked partially. 

No one close to me in my life knows about any of this. I have kept it all hidden. It weighs so heavy on me that I feel sometimes like the thoughts alone are killing me. It's so exhausting and isolating. I wouldn't even know how to begin to try to explain it to someone.

I'm literally trapped in limbo and I have been for so long. I'm wasting the best years of my life, waiting for the moment that these horrible thoughts make themselves so loud I can't ignore them.  It's ruining everything - my happiness, relationship, my work - but I know that a positive test would ruin everything so much more. I wouldn't be able to cope. I know I wouldn't. I'd honestly rather die.

I don't really know what I am trying to get out of posting on here - I guess this is the first time I have laid it all out before me. Usually these thoughts are just running a rampage in my mind, causing me to obsessively google symptoms and read reddit pages for reassurance, but I am at the point now where i am wondering if it is just denial - it seems too big of a coincidence that I have so many symptoms, for it not to be a positive result.  

I guess any advice from anyone would be appreciated or any heartening stories I can get strength from x

Additional note: These are the symptoms I have at the moment:  
\- Small dry patch on arm

1j8bm5b,2025-03-11 04:08:44,Lamictal experience so far (+ question),"I mostly wanna make this post because I feel a few people have asked me about it already. I've been taking lamictal for my anxiety since December and right now I'm at 150mg. I went through a number of SSRIs before finally landing on this (Lexapro, Zoloft, Prozac) and cymbalta.


From what I've heard, lamictal is mostly used to treat bipolar as a mood stabilizer, which I don't have. But it's worked very well for my anxiety. It's very manageable. Not completely gone, but I'm able to exist day to day much better than without it.


One of the ""effects"" I realized is it's made me way more talkative and sociable. I chalked it up to my anxiety being mostly taken care of so I don't feel like I'm masking myself as much. I'm more talkative and unfiltered.


Something my psychiatrist told me though that I didn't consider is that it could be emerging adhd symptoms. I didn't consider that. I suspected having adhd but never had enough evidence for it. Both my dad and sister have it, so it isn't out of the question. If this is true though, it's hard to fathom I had so much anxiety that I was masking unknowingly for that long. This isn't a diagnosis by any means and I'm mostly just supposed to be keeping an eye on it as I raise my dose.

1j8bfkr,2025-03-11 04:01:04,How cam I seek comfort in my dog when she isn't upstairs?,"I (15 fem) have a dog called lola. A beagle. I'm doing my gcses this year and ontop of everything else I stress about things a lot. Lola really seems to help me as she is always happy and I know she wants to play with me and sit with me and things like that. However for some reason I stress more at night. I struggle to breathe at this point and am barley sleeping. Part of me felt as if it was lying down and wasn't a worry thing but I'm not too sure as I lay with lola before bed downstairs and I am fine because I am focused on her.

I was just wondering that even though it is a long shot, if anyone had any ideas on what to do? I have my dog and a few hobbies as stress relieves that work at that time however as soon as I leave I worry again and I'm not too sure if there's any solutions. I've tried all the basics such as breathing techniques, music, fidgets etc but nothing seems to work well.

1j82o4o,2025-03-10 21:56:58,Has anyone actually noticed a direct correlation with lack of sleep and anxiety?,"
I’ve been sleeping horrible for several months now. Most night I only get 3 hours straight at a time. On days I wasn’t working I would be going to bed between 5-7 am because of insomnia, then getting up at 12-1 and then feeling panic because of the guilt about it. 

The past few weeks I can’t get any stretches over 3 hours, and cannot sleep in at all.

This started I believe with worrying about the wildfires in LA since I have friends that live there and have been through it myself, but just continued on.

I’m a middle-age (weird) women and I feel like this has just gotten worse with age.


In general I’m very anxious all day, but I’m wondering how many of you actually truly have noticed you have MORE anxiety and less regulation because of lack of sleep. Not just online saying it - but personal experiences.

Thank you in advance.

1j8agbs,2025-03-11 03:18:39,What was your biggest help to reduce the fear of fear?,"I’ve always suffered from anxiety, but it’s got so much worse after a hospital trip. I came out of hospital in a horrible state of panic and my head hasn’t been the same since. 

There is a TLDR at the bottom. 

I was in hospital, didn’t sleep for 3 days and became very anxious. They give me a 5mg Lorazepam (never had it before) to relax me and help me sleep. The next 48 hours were awful. My head didn’t feel like it was attached to my body. I felt like my head wasn’t my own. I wanted to jump in front of a car. 

Things got better after - the loudness went and I felt my head connected again. But ever since I’ve been terrified of it happening again. I’m so hyper focused on how my head feels. 

I don’t want to leave the house incase I have such intense anxiety that I can’t cope. The moment my head feels a bit weird, I start to panic I’m going to go insane and back to that 48 hours. 

I need to find a way to move on from this fear of fear I have. I don’t want to have anxiety over anxiety. I want to get better. I know medication will help but I’m scared to restart citalopram as (despite not having side effects in the past) I’ve read such negative stories, I’m too scared to start. So while I pluck up the courage, any tips on how to reduce the fear of fear itself and natural ways you managed your anxiety would help!

Was in the ER last week for shortness of breath. Got an EKG and blood test. Overall healthy with the exception of discovering I’m pre-diabetic and have a high blood pressure, with my resting sitting at 140/100. I’ve noticed I’ve started twitching a lot since the visit.

1j84s95,2025-03-10 23:23:49,"Does anyone find that being productive for the day with something meaningful, and/or TALKING a lot for the day really helps your anxiety?","I’m wondering if anyone notices this. I think that when I engage in something meaningful/productive/ maybe even when I get to show my talents or just be “needed” or useful, I think it’s possible it may really help my anxiety. 

For example, right now I only teach part time and on my own schedule. I have been out of work for several months do to other issues, and have been feeling so much anxiety also from I believe not really doing anything. Today I taught for only a half hour and felt so much better after. It was nice to see the child really get what I was teaching and using skills I taught them in the past. I loved seeing their confidence. I just felt more calm and at ease after.

I don’t know how long it will last, but hopefully through the day. 😂


The other thing is I have ADHD as well. As a female with ADHD we learn that many of us need to basically chat out our energy. I wonder if the talking really helps also? Yesterday I talked to my parents for an hour and a half and I felt so calm in the afternoon and night — something I haven’t felt in weeks basically. I wasn’t sure if it was something else I was doing or the talking, but I’ve definitely been wondering about it. 


Just wondering if anyone else notices/noticed a correlation with either one of these.

So you understand what my anxiety has been like lately — it’s basically panic all day, sometimes night. Kind of feeling like I want to crawl out of my own skin bc it’s so uncomfortable. High heart rate/general uncomfortability. Kind of like prolonged panic attacks — but sometimes in full panic attack mode.

1j84hd9,2025-03-10 23:11:17,"Considering Prozac after having a panic attack 5 months ago, little worried though...","Long story short, last October I was given buspirone to help with GAD. Everything was fine after ~3 weeks on it, I made the mistake of taking a couple hits on a joint (which I had done regularly for years and never had issues) which apparently interacted with the buspirone and triggered a massive panic attack and ended up in the ER - pulse shot up from 80 to 170 within a minute, BP went up to 160/100, had numbness in my limbs, etc etc. Honestly thought I was having a heart attack/stroke. I've only ever had general anxiety before, never had a panic attack in my life. Stopped the buspirone immediately. Also haven't smoked since.

Fast forward 5+ months later, and I feel like I've developed some anxiety/depression issue I never had before the panic attack. Constant fatigue, brain fog, head pressure, minor panic that comes and goes, having serious trouble focusing on my work, hardly ever want to get off the couch and do anything with my family once I get home I just feel so mentally drained for no reason.

I had a GP give me prozac. But I'm a bit nervous to try it honestly. I see some of the reports of people specifically getting panic attacks from prozac (of course these are anecdotal reports on reddit so no clue how severe or common it really is). However, I definitely think it was the COMBINATION of thc + adjusting to the buspirone that likely triggered the panic attack, so the more rational side of me says that even if prozac causes some panic symptoms, it will be manageable... all the mini panic symptoms I had after quitting the buspar kind of sucked at times, but they were manageable - nothing that was going to send me back to the hospital. However, the part of me that is still scarred from the panic attack is freaking out that taking prozac will cause another huge panic attack.

Anyone ever have a similar experience? How likely/bad can the increased anxiety from prozac really be? Plan was to start at 10mg for a week then increase to 20mg.

But still my body feels like off. Idk how to explain it. It's just a weird feeling with pretty much my whole body.

Never never never had anything like this with anxiety before. It makes me wonder if it's actually a flare up due to my auto immune issues or connective tissue disease but all the doctors dismiss it as anxiety no matter how bad I tell them my symptoms are. I went to the ER twice because I physically couldn't sleep. 

I want this to end. I want to feel normal again. It's only been a week. I know things like this take time but has anyone had something like this before.

Since then I have been a mess and most days have felt like hell. Constant rumination, headaches, weird burning pains, and an overall feeling of dread and feeling unsettled.

I became obsessed with trying to get back to my normal self. I’ve spent over $400 on supplements, thousands on doctor visits, medications, therapy,
read a ton of literature about it, and other natural remedies like mindfulness and meditation.

I’m finally found the right medication after trying meds like Prozac, Zoloft, buspar, gabapenton, pregabalin, Xanax, klonapin, and thyroid meds. From that list only the benzo’s helped and I was too afraid to take them consistently. I finally was put on a medication called Notriptyline. Slowly but surely I noticed I wasn’t obsessing and my head started to feel better. My starting dose was 10mg and now currently on 50mg. I feel better with zero to little anxiety and my motivation to do things is much higher than even before the anxiety disorder. Somedays I don’t believe how good I feel.

From all the natural anxiety books I read the main point was to focus and accept the anxiety. But when you’re in constant anguish daily for two years giving it your best shot and nothing really improves I think medication is the only possible route. My point is keep trying don’t give up.

1j87irl,2025-03-11 01:16:34,Health,"(TW for health concerns) Hi guys, again. I just need to vent. I’ve been in pain these last couple of days, and I can’t get over the fear that urgent care isn’t doing enough. I am terrified they missed something. Yes I’m diagnosed with OCD.

I was told I have a UTI but in the back of my mind I really, REALLY cannot stop googling and worrying about what if it’s something worse, because my symptoms are abnormal. I’m nauseous and haven’t been able to eat and I don’t know if it’s due to my anxiety or the UTI. My abdomen hurts, and it’s getting worse. This is my third time venting about it here, I believe. It’s been rough.

I can’t even sleep properly. My dreams are filled with my anxieties, and I wake up and immediately begin to worry. I spend my entire day worrying that maybe I’m getting worse, maybe it spread to my kidneys, maybe it’s a kidney stone or my gallbladder and they’re missing everything..

This has been the toughest week I’ve had, I don’t like to not feel like I’m healing up. I don’t like that it’s going on for so long (over a week now!) with no improvements. I currently feel a lot towards people who have chronic illnesses, I can’t imagine living with pain or illness permanently. One week and I feel like I’ve had enough, I never want to deal with this again for the rest of my life.

I’m also becoming increasingly worried about the nausea, I just want to go back to being able to eat. I can’t stomach food, my food aversion is so terrible it’s like my throat closes whenever I try to swallow anything solid. I feel like I’m putting myself in danger by not eating but with this illness I physically can’t. 

Thanks to anyone who reads. I just don’t know where to turn to for support, I’ve truly exhausted every other source I could go to even just to vent. I am going back to the doctor today.

My family is too busy with other stuff, i got too wrapped up into work and a negative lifestyle and over the past few years lost alot of social contact.  

Does beating social anxiety boil down to going out there and practicing? I feel like the anxiety has become a part of me and even in the most comfortable situation’s it takes control over me. But is this thing really only beatable by practice? Cause if so i don’t mind that , i can put myself in a mind-state where i have to socialise daily. It’s draining, but if that’s truly what it takes then so be it.

My therapist tells me that i should start my day off believing i’m a person worth talking to, and a person of value but that doesn’t really help in the long run.

1j86anj,2025-03-11 00:24:58,"Prepping for a cross-country move, afraid of making the wrong choice","In December, my partner (28M) and I (35M) are quitting our jobs and moving to Los Angeles for greener, bluer pastures than rural Indiana after three years of planning and my ten+ years of yearning. We've both lived in large cities before (he grew up in DC and I lived in Montreal for two years) so the size/adaptation to city life isn't an issue for us. We're both highly skilled and have existing connections, so we're not (super) afraid we won't find work. I was 21 hours away from home when I lived in Montreal, so it's not proximity to people I know that's a problem. Mostly, it's actually a money and time thing. It's going to cost a lot, which we're almost ready for, but I fear getting there, hating it, admitting defeat, and wanting moving somewhere else after burning through so much to get there. I also fear that I'm uprooting my life at a time when I need to be planting and growing in my career because of my age + the world situation. I think I know where this is all coming from, though:

My family.

  
None of them want me to move out there, none of them like my partner, and they're all convinced I'm making a terrible mistake. There's four of us in my core family (idgaf about extended, those people aren't involved in my life) and my folks and brother each have their own reasons for not wanting me to move there. My brother thinks I'll be happier in NYC (I do love it and it's very familiar so he's not totally wrong, but I'm ready to explore someplace new) and my folks want me closer to Chattanooga (f\*ck no) because they're mid-60's boomers that didn't take care of their bodies or use their money wisely so they ""can't afford"" to travel (the way they want - comfort plane seats, Hiltons, and taxis/ubers 5+ times a day). They all, despite not one of them having ever been to LA, ""don't like it"" and think of only the worst parts of it, much like all of America does about NYC and that city is fine! As for my partner, for my folks it's just because my mom's a huge homophobic and racist bigot and my dad just goes along with her, and my brother thinks I deserve better and no one is ever good enough (which I appreciate but it def makes me doubt myself and my relationship). 

I feel like I'm going into this move (and an upcoming trip to visit LA next week) with all their negativity in my head and a fear that I'm going to make a total fool of myself and go skulking back to TN with my tail between my legs, single, broke, clearly stupid, and too old to make anything of myself. Our trip next week is an exploratory trip and fun vacation where we'll see friends, eat good food, and do some sightseeing. I'm having a very, VERY hard time shutting down the negativity and getting into an excited instead of petrified headspace for it and don't want to spend the week on edge/miserable. 

How can I break out of this and enjoy my vacation, and how can I stop being afraid of this thing that I've wanted all this time finally coming true?

  
TL;DR: Moving from the Midwest to LA in December with partner of two years, I'm deeply afraid I'm shooting myself in the foot and making a life-altering wrong choice bc of anxiety and an unsupportive family, but have desperately wanted to move out there for over a decade so I'm doing it scared.

I’ll try to pen it down clearly.

I 24F, having self-harming thoughts lately if exactly not suicidal. I’ve been ignoring and suppressing it. I am in a relationship and I did something in my past which keeps affecting my relationship and Idk how to manoeuvre that. It triggers the anxiety that I didn’t know would become this bad. And my anxiety shadows every time when he need help or wants me to be there for him and help him process his emotions (it’s mostly related to things that I did) and I totally understand that how frustrating it must be for him though he has mentioned it sometimes that It becomes too much for him to handle. 
I usually tell him that I am anxious and he’s very kind and patient and helps me by talking through it sometimes for hours. And Ik it’s exhausting for him too so I just get in the loop again that he’ll leave me because I am too dependent on him and it drains him. And maybe he’ll do much better with someone who’ll make things easier for him unlike me.
I feel and Ik I am responsible for this ugly part for my life. I should’ve thought about consequences before doing things and now when it’s coming back to me I just can’t take it. I mostly feel like punishing myself for hurting him. 
I sometimes want to hurt myself so bad so that I can stop feeling the other pain. 
Sometimes I feel like punching myself in the face or just taking high doses of meds to loose my consciousness and make it better for people around me. I once felt like killing myself with meds.
The thought of it sometimes just makes things go down a hell-hole.


I constantly feel pain left side of my chest. The intensity keeps changing depending upon how anxious I am. But it never completely goes away. It just fades and becomes feeble if I am not anxious but still exists. 
Sometimes, the pain extends to my left arm and I have been feeling like something’s gonna happen to me.

I am really afraid to loose him. And anything that makes me feel that I’m gonna loose him
just makes it worse. 
I could barely sleep without him next to me. Even if I am asleep my brain wouldn’t rest and I could feel that in my sleep. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night because the pain in my chest becomes unbearable. I couldn’t even sleep with my anxiety meds rn.

1j7rtt3,2025-03-10 11:18:49,I just want to feel normal again,"About 6 months ago, I got bit/stung by some kind of insect while outside with my family. I’ve been stung by wasps, bees, yellowjackets etc. several times and while I got some pretty severe swelling it always went away after a while. Well, this time it freaked me out for some reason and before I even had any allergic symptoms I began thinking in the back of my mind that I was about to go into anaphylactic shock. About an hour later, I went to the restroom with my shirt off and noticed a bunch of hives spread up my torso, they didn’t itch but were widespread which terrified me and sent me into a full blown panic attack. I took a Benadryl, passed out and they were gone in the morning.

Ever since this happened, I’ve been absolutely horrified of developing a sudden, severe allergy.
This fear has consumed me and led to me developing more health related fears.

Every single day I live alone, in fear. I wake up, go to my job which I hate, struggle through the day (with little to no symptoms) but when I get home, when I should be relaxing, I begin to notice rashes, redness and small breakouts of hives. I have dermatographia as well which doesn’t help this fear. I’m terrified of the doctors office as well, so finding out if I’m actually allergic is off the table. My friends and family are frustrated by my constant worry, and it’s beginning to affect my job performance.
Recently moved out of my parents house on my own and it’s compounded the fear tenfold.

It feels like there’s no end in sight
It feels like it’s going to get worse
I feel like I am going to go insane or die
I am so terrified
I am so sorry.
I wouldn’t wish this hell on anybody.
I suppose I just need to vent or something, I know it won’t really be forever I’ve beaten this health anxiety/OCD whatever it is before. Went away and stayed gone for 4 years then just creeped back up on me. It’s a crippling blow to realize that I’m back in this cycle stronger than I was before

Thing is, since the day after I started having soft, pebble like stool every morning for like two or three times. I stopped taking probiotics five days ago, but the soft stool in the morning is still there, and sometimes in the evening I have a normal, small bowel movement. Aside from the probiotics probably softening my stool, I think my anxiety is playing a big part in this, but I don't know how to calm myself down. It's all a big loop: I get anxious about the soft stool, so I get the soft stool, which gives me anxiety, and so on... I'm so tired of all this. I started seeing a therapist last week for my anxiety/emetophobia, and on Wednesday I'll probably bring this whole thing up as well.

1j7yofa,2025-03-10 19:02:09,"Extreme anxiety - little realisation of how bad it is, and any help?","For 4 years I've had pretty bad anxiety with shivering, sweating, high blood pressure, tachycardia, A LOT OF DIZZINESS. 

Because work stresses me out, I obviously get all of the symptoms, especially dizziness when studying, and I dislike this feeling and then become scared of it, creating a loop. I'm now completely stuck, even when my work is super easy, my brain has created this automatic loop of freaking out as soon as I have to study, and making me dizzy instantly. Which then makes working hard, making me freak out etc etc. 

  
Today as an experiment I took 2 of my benzos, and started studying. Now my dizziness isn't as bad at all, but I am still sweating like crazy, with insane sweating, and fast beating heart. 

  
This just made me realise how fucking bad my anxiety is, I have 2 pills in me that are so good at neutralising anxiety that people become addicted to it, and I'm sitting in my own home, as comfortable as can be, doing some work, and I'm sweating like I'm about to get executed. 



I understand I need to get to the root of my issue but I'm so blinded by my dizziness and anxiety that I can't think at all. I can't get to the root of my issue like this, therefore I really need some medication to help me out. I started zoloft a week ago but absolutely no help there yet. The benzos help kinda but as I just explained, it reaaallly doesn't do the job as good as I would hope. 

  
My question is which such severe crippling anxiety, what medication even works, if 2 benzo pills don't...

I was shaking rapid heart beat sweating. and I ended up in hospital and it went away, I left fine. I've had smaller versions of attacks every day since then but they are slowing down now.  But ever since, I have been so worried about my health. My period is days late now, and i dont know why. that's adding stress too. i have random chest pains/tightness. Sometimes, my head feels heavy. I don't do good in crowded spaces anymore the symptoms just worsen. I feel faint sometimes and just an overall weird feeling where I feel like I need to get out I have always had anxiety but never to this extent. it's been so heightened ever since the attack.

I got an EKG and bloodwork and everything was normal and usually that'd bring me peace and it's not.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm not me. I want the physical symptoms to go away and they do sometimes but they ALWAYS come back within minutes or hours. what can i do? as someone who also struggles with health anxiety, the physical symptoms are just killing me and making it so much worse.

1gd9l9c,2024-10-27 17:43:33,Elections and Politics,"Hello friends!

It's that time of the year again. We have always intended for r/mentalhealth to be a safe, politically neutral space for users, and we wish to keep it that way. We will be removing and locking threads that go out of hand with the political aspects of things.

Political anxiety is more common than you think around election time. If you are having trouble with political anxiety, there are ways to cope with the stress. Here are a few examples:

**Timeout**: Social media, including the news channels, are designed to have a negative tilt to collect views. They want you to keep coming back for more. It is an excellent idea to differentiate between thoughtful and stress-inducing, sensationalized material. It is okay to find out about news after it breaks. By waiting for accurate information and thoughtful analyses, you will be able to provide informative content for yourself. Limiting the use of social media to once or twice a day will be beneficial. If your political anxiety is still too much to handle, it might be time to take an extended break.

**Control**: The majority of what is happening in national and global politics is out of our personal control. Turning our attention to ourselves, our friends, families, and local communities can help us be empowered and productive. Engaging in activities you enjoy, such as hobbies, exercise, and time with friends, can be a healthy distraction. Practicing self-care through wellness techniques and programs can also help keep your anxiety in check. Here are some websites that provide helpful information and tips on self-care:

[MHA: Taking Good Care of Yourself](https://mhanational.org/taking-good-care-yourself)

[NHS: Self-Help Therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/self-help-therapies/)

[El Camino Health: Emotional Self Care](https://www.elcaminohealth.org/community/chinese-health-initiative/specialty-programs/emotional-well-being/emotional-self-care)

**Community**: Connect with individuals who provide a safe space for understanding current events. Sharing what you are thinking and feeling with trusted peers can mitigate the negative effects of stress.

**Engage**: The feeling of helplessness can be stressful and discouraging. Getting involved with a local political party, volunteering with a community group, or participating in activism can help you feel a sense of accomplishment, power, and purpose. These activities also connect communities of like-minded people, which helps to alleviate stress.

**If you are experiencing a crisis or medical emergency, please contact your local emergency services. We have a** [list of resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/wiki/index/resources/) **on our sidebar as well as a link to a** [global index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines) **of emergency numbers.**

1e297nd,2024-07-13 17:55:58,r/MentalHealth is looking for moderators,"Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What do the mods do?

Moderators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)

# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?

Mod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?

Yes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

1j8g5fu,2025-03-11 07:40:04,Brother tried killing my mom and mother is now trying to run away with him.,"Hey there. Never done this before, never had the need too. Hope someone can help me with this situation. So about 2 days ago, I was going to pick up my 1 year and 4 month old daughter from her mom. She lives about 3 hours away, had to meet halfway. Around 10 minutes before arriving home, I call my mother and ask if she knew where her shoes are because I wanted to take to her to the park. Come to find out, my brother of 35 years of age, tried to kill my mom and my 30 year old brother. I will make it simpler but no names. Brother aged 35 will be called C, brother aged 30 will be called N. N has Asperger’s, so it is harder for him to live on his own and be able to take care of himself. It’s harder for him in social situations, especially stressful ones, he was diagnosed at a very young age. But he is very responsible and a stand up guy, he has a job, a girlfriend, cleans up after himself, doesn’t smoke, barely drinks. Overall an amazing guy. C on the other hand, was addicted to heroin at one point in his life, had a bad drinking problem for a while just like my father did for 20 years, he stays in the basement all day, every day, all night every night. His room is a disaster. Bottles, garbage EVERYWHERE. This room is small mind you. Just garbage after garbage. Imagine a hoarder house in one single room. I mean it’s horrible. Doesn’t have any friends, doesn’t do literally anything at all. Back to the story, I have a daughter who turns 2 this year. I’ve lived with my mom my whole life. She has done nothing but support me and she loves her grandbaby very much. More than most things in the world. On my way home from picking up my daughter, I call my mom about the shoes. About 10 minutes away from being home. She answered hysterically, saying “Your brother just tried to kill us. He stabbed N in the back of the head with a shard of glass and he’s going to the hospital right now. He’s still conscious and okay but it’s bad. He punched me over and over again and tried to stab me too. He was talking about how we’re demons and he’s gonna kill us. He didn’t even know who I was. He tried stabbing me with a piece of sharp wood from his window.” Long story short, this mf had some kind of religious psychosis. I go to the hospital, to make sure N is okay. Luckily, he is. All he needed was a staple so we got very lucky. Keep in mind, this all happened yesterday. I wasn’t even home when this happened. A few of the days prior to this incident C started to act very strange. He started coming up, trying to talk to me, I mean he has never done that in his life. He started to act really weird and creepy. Just overall uncomfortable for everyone. Things started to get worse. The morning of the incident he came into my room again, asking me what me and my girlfriend were doing, telling him I have to go pick up my daughter soon. He started to look under my girlfriend’s pillows. Like really uncomfortable shit. He got arrested because of this. No Sh!t. I’m glad he did. He resisted the cops with violence, they tased him but nothing so they had to wrestle this mf to the ground. After he was arrested he went to the hospital to get a brain scan. They found a mass in his brain. Therefore no charges from the County. Now my mom wants him to come back since she “can’t” abandon him. Wtf? I now have two choices to find somewhere to stay, which I have zero time for, or take the house and my mom will leave with C and my two dogs. She has been acting hysterical.

The biggest problems I have is with being highly impulsive and lacking any self control or will power. I make constant excuses for my habits. I smoke, don’t sleep, spend excessive amounts of time online, obsess over stupid things and eat shitty foods. It’s at the point where I think I might be at the brink of a nervous breakdown downs.

So I had an epiphany tonight. Why not just ask myself one important question each time I do these harmful things to myself. 

“Is this going to make me feel better in the long run?”  

If the answers ‘no’ then I’m simply not going to do it.

Such a simple question, but I’m so sick of over complicating things, which is what I do best.

I’ve decided to take a militant approach to this.

So, I feel like having a smoke. Am I gong to feel better in the long run? NO. 

The missus said something triggering and that feel like I should defend myself, but I know it’s going to start a fight… NO… I’m going to keep my mouth shut.

I want to order a pizza instead of eating the chicken salad I have no n the fridge… NO.

I’m tired and want to sleep, but I have an overwhelming urge to scroll social media. Should I just go to sleep… YES… into bed I go. Turn off the lights and just lay there u til I get the much needed sleep I need.

This just dumbs down all the bullshit justifications I keep using to justify my shitty and damaging behaviour.

On April 5 2024 I was raped by a guy I had met a month before. I posted on legaladvicecanada on April 7 asking for advice. I was scared, embarrassed and felt guilty about what I had let happen to me ( I still blame myself) 

I instantly received an instant amount of support and information. I never was going to speak about what happened to anyone, let alone report it. After all the support I received I reached out for help and decided to report what happened. 

There has been a legal investigation and upcoming trial. The legal side of things is worse than the event itself honestly. 

Since the assault my mental health has deteriorated significantly. I have suffered very badly with anxiety, sleeping, being touched by anyone.

I have to attend counselling (therapy and see a psychiatrist) and talking about things constantly makes me go into a state of complete insanity. I feel like I’m going to faint, my body shakes, I can’t control my emotions. 

Im doing the work in therapy but what I’m doing now just isn’t working and I’m very tired of living like this. Is there anything else that can help me get over this? Or is my life ruined forever.

I’m 17 and have struggled since I was around 10 with my mental health. I hate to self diagnose but my mum is bipolar and I also show a lot of signs so this makes me believe I may also have bipolar. I also struggle with anxiety and depression. I go months where I feel fine, overly happy almost psychotic and then months where I can’t do anything but rot in my room. This time round it has gotten so bad that I have been having so many suicidal thoughts and making plans on how to do it and also harming myself in other ways. I have had therapy before with various people and always saw that it never really helped me as it just turned me into a nervous wreck due to my anxiety and the thought of going every week would make me so anxious I’d be sick. I’ve never tried any medication but was wondering if a GP in the uk is able to prescribe any medication to me whether that be antidepressants or anything else I am unsure what is available to me. This is an unusual thing to me as I have never wanted medication and this is the first time I am seeking help by myself instead of something worrying about me and doing it for me.

i grew up hating myself and even wishing not to be born (due to a lot of problems that i wont mention)  
i always thought that it was normal to feel suicidal and absolutely despise yourself, like the only thing that come to my mind when i see a beautiful view is that it will eventually disappear, and i dont care anymore about if i fail in my life or if i lose a job because we will die anyways and all of this doesnt matter  
until i talked about this topic with a friend in uni, who was shocked.

so i naturally talked about this with my mother (since we are very family oriented in my country) but she again mocked me and told me all of this is happening because im not religious enough (i am) and what im feeling is not real.

i started harming myself (it felt good but i didnt want to have scars for the rest of my life so now i stopped) and didnt talk about my problems for anyone, but i still feel concerned, is it okay to feel like this and just carry on with my life?

1j8mkvl,2025-03-11 14:40:26,INADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES GREATER MANCHESTER.,"
Hi, my name is Alys and I am fund-raising for my little brother who is now 29 years old. He is wise, loving, extremely good at chess and has the best, most eclectic taste in music!
My brothers life has been extremely tumultuous and challenging to say the least. He was classed as a ‘naughty kid’ in school and very much inhabited that persona out of anger, confusion and being misunderstood.
He was later diagnosed with ADHD in his mid-twenties. He was in and out of jobs and struggled to function in society and maintain any friendships or relationships. He has also experienced a lot of traumas throughout his life and consequently developed alcohol and drug dependency as a way to self-medicate and numb his feelings.
He was first hospitalised nearly 3 years ago under Greater Manchester Mental Health and was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. He became particularly erratic, irrational and unpredictable. He struggles with severe depression, anxiety and paranoia. It has been extremely challenging because he can flip from loving and vulnerable to very scary and aggressive.
As a family, we have been fighting so so hard for years now to get him the right help and support that he needs. It has been really difficult and we have hit so many brick walls and been let down many times. We dread to think what happens to those who don’t have a family or loved ones to fight and advocate for them. My brother is a very complex person who is massively suffering. He is confused and just wants stability and connection.
He has been in and out of hospital for nearly 3 years. The social care system in this country seems to be seriously underfunded and he isn’t getting the help that he needs. Every time we feel like we are getting somewhere and being taken seriously, we are told that peoples hands are tied. He has slipped through nets all of his life and continues to do so.
If we could raise enough money to get him some help privately, it would be unbelievably life changing for him. We have been told that he needs to be in an intensive psychiatric unit, but we can’t get him on the right section to be eligible. He also can’t go into an adult rehab where he would learn life skills, tools and resources because he has struggles with addiction. In this day and age, we know that trauma, addiction and mental illness are all interlinked.
My brother is under a section 117, which means legally they have to provide a roof over his head to ‘prevent relapse and maintain stability after leaving a mental health hospital.’ Instead, my brother has been unlawfully treated despite his psychological condition and as a result has been left homeless. Unfortunately, the NHS don't treat people with co-occurring conditions like my brother. It is crucial that we as a society make a joint effort to destigmatise the topic of addiction and globalise treatment for all; we must aim to treat the human, not the condition.
This fight is now causing us all to crumble.
Please share our story and help raise awareness for people like my brother, we would be incredibly grateful.
We intend to use whatever funds we can raise to go towards a stay in a private hospital that treats co-occurring illnesses such as addiction, psychosis and schizoaffective disorder. With the right help, he could live a contented life and have a future.

I will try to make this short as possible and skip any unnecessary details.

I didn’t think this would work, it was way too obvious and my problems were way too intricate for something like this to work. But within days it was obvious something was different. I had a different pep in my step, I was me at my best all the time. 

Stop believing your own bullshit. Stop hugging so tightly the sob story you tell yourself. I’m not saying trauma isn’t real, I know it is. But the way we cope with it is we tell ourselves this story, and the story isn’t true. 

You are who you are right now. In this moment. Standing (or sitting) here with your phone in your hand. 

Who you aren’t are the things that have happened to you or that you’ve done to yourself. 

Identify your story as bullshit and separate from it. This is what has brought me a second chance at life. AMA. ❤️

1j8kuqx,2025-03-11 12:25:23,"""How can I gently begin to improve my mental health and find more balance in my daily life?""","Improving mental health and finding balance in daily life is less about radical transformations and more about the small, consistent steps that shape the narrative of our everyday existence. It’s about understanding the complexity of the mind while embracing the simple, scientific, and even spiritual solutions that help us navigate the chaos.

The Science of Small Steps

Neuroscience teaches us that our brains thrive on routine. This concept, known as neuroplasticity, explains how consistent small habits can reshape the brain’s pathways, influencing how we process stress and emotions. The problem is that when mental health feels fragile, even small steps seem mountainous. But science shows that starting small—like taking five mindful breaths or going for a ten-minute walk—can activate positive changes in the brain, reducing cortisol levels and improving emotional balance over time.

My Own Battle for Balance

I remember a time when stress wasn’t just a feeling; it was the backdrop of my existence. Work pressures, personal expectations, and an unrelenting inner critic made it feel like I was walking through life with a storm cloud over my head. The mornings were the hardest. Waking up felt like facing a mountain I had no strength to climb.

One morning, I decided to do something simple. Instead of scrolling through my phone, I sat on my balcony and watched the sunrise. It was awkward at first—just sitting there, watching the sky change colors. But it became a habit. And that habit became a ritual. Over time, it wasn’t just about watching the sunrise; it was about giving myself permission to pause, to breathe, to exist without the pressure of productivity.

It didn’t solve everything. But it became a moment of peace, an anchor in an otherwise chaotic day. Sometimes, that’s all we need—one moment that reminds us the world isn’t as heavy as it feels.

Ancient Wisdom on Balance

This journey toward balance isn’t just a modern challenge. Thousands of years ago, the Bhagavad-gītā spoke about this delicate dance of inner steadiness. In Chapter 6, Verse 17, it is said:

""He who is temperate in his habits of eating, sleeping, working, and recreation can mitigate all material pains by practicing the yoga system.""


Srila Prabhupada’s Insight on Inner Well-being

""Happiness is not a matter of external circumstances but of internal consciousness.""
.
Steps Toward a Balanced Mind

If you’re wondering how to begin improving mental health, start where you are. Begin gently.

1. Mindful Breathing: Take five deep breaths when you feel overwhelmed. It’s a small action, but it signals your nervous system to relax.


2. Consistent Sleep: Aim for a consistent sleep routine. Sleep isn’t just rest; it’s the mind’s way of resetting and healing.

He said all kinds of lies. I was actually at home, but the police ended up sending me to the hospital for a ""check-up."" This led to a week-long stay for mental health reasons. I've been out for two months now, and I want to stop the outpatient services. I want to take control of my medications and get rid of the pointless telehealth setup. I'm still considered a voluntary patient, but it doesn’t feel that way since they seem indifferent. This whole situation feels like a tactic from someone I'm genuinely scared of. 

How can I put an end to this, and what might happen if I do? I just want it to be over. They're not providing any real therapy support; they just keep piling on hospital bills and pushing more medication without understanding my trauma or the control this person has over me.

1j8k8k9,2025-03-11 11:39:50,Why don’t I feel connected to anyone,"Im an 18 yr old guy and For the last 4 years I would guess I haven’t actually felt connected to anyone. I’ve come to the realization that no one who I consider close to me is close enough to the point where I can properly vent about my deepest darkest thoughts. Before you ask this is not imposter syndrome nor did I have a rough childhood growing up, I had two loving parents (who only just recently got a divorce) a brother and a sister who are both younger than me. Obviously I love them but not to the point where I would come to them with any mental health problems.
 

I felt this the most when my grandpa died, I was close with him just like everyone else in my family but I felt no sadness when he did die. I didn’t dwell on it, I didn’t shed a tear, I basically just shrugged my shoulders and went on my with life. I’m scared that I have no empathy and that this is how I’ll feel when anyone close to me dies. 

I don’t care that people are suffering, my friends tell me about their problems and all I can think about is what I’d rather be doing than listen to them pour their heart out to me about what their going through which makes me feel really awkward in the moment and unable to sympathize with their situation. I feel like a psychopath.

I also have no desire to date/ get to know someone romantically as I have a very pessimistic view on relationship and that I think they will all end up ending poorly (I’ve never been in a romantic relationship)

I have little friends, work alone and I really want to branch out but my anxiety is keeping me locked in. 

What's happens when the panic comes? Stuttering, shaking, tunnel vision, cloudy head, not thinking before speaking, and issues with eye contact. I also feel lethargic and spacey a lot. 

As I said earlier, right now I used a tiny bit of benzo. But I don't want to use the benzo and I can't get a script for it anyway. I'm either looking for something that will help on a daily basis or something that can be taken prior to. Ideally trying to stay away from anything that affects libido as I've been on SSRIs like Zoloft and did not want to engage in s3x at all.

I'm thinking about gabapentin, propanol or SSRI? 

I'm in therapy doing EMDR (not focusing on anxiety but stuff that correlates to it). But it's not helping as of now. 

My therapist suggested adding an anti anxiety med in the interim.. has anybody used it temporarily and got off without returning issues?

So I know this guy from high school since, like, 2 years. He's mostly been a ""class friend"", meaning that we were hanging out but only in school. I remember that a year ago, we were in a PE class (I think we were playing ultimate frisbee) and he seemed to have fun and stuff. But then, his mood suddenly changed. He seemed really moonstuck, kind of preoccupied by something. He became kind of irritable and told me to leave him alone, so that's what I did. After class, I met a teacher and explained him what happened, because I couldn't stop thinking about it. The teacher told me that he will call at the guy's home just to be sure that everything is fine and that if he asks for help, the school's psychologist could reach out to him and maybe arrange an appointment with him. Of course, the teacher promised me to not tell the guy that I ""snitched"" (even tho I still believe I did the right thing) and I left the teacher's office, pretty sure that I did a good thing.

  
Flash-forward a year later. I'm still class friend with the same guy and we go together on a school trip.

As always, most of the time he was chill, cracking jokes and having fun, but I could clearly see that he had dark thoughts because at least 4 or 5 times during the trip, he became irritable, moonstuck and preoccupied like he did during that PE class, one year ago.

But also, worse, I saw him many times making suicide jokes, imitating suicide (like literally imitating blowing out his brain whenever someone would mention death in a board game or whatever) or even saying that he's suicidal with a perfectly straight face. Not as a joke or everything. He clearly meant it.

  
So now, the trip is over, and I'm kind of scared for him. I'm wondering if I should do something again, because I feel like his mental state did not really get any better.

1j8hzrc,2025-03-11 09:17:31,How to stop being “combative”,"Firstly, I have OCD, ADHD, and depression diagnosed by a professional (if that’s helpful at all)

At work, I am often seen as a “problem solver” or “analytical” because I find issues before they arise by asking a lot of questions. 

At home, those same actions get viewed as combative or argumentative. 

For example, if a peer suggests I do something differently with my work project, I will often pick it apart. Not in a way to try to be rude or dismissive, but to see if there are any flaws in the plan. Then I move from there. I have never been a “Hey you! Do this thing” and I just say “ok” type of person. There are typically several follow up questions. 

I can see why my partner finds these actions to be combative. I would probably be frustrated too if I was helping my partner in a game and every time I told them to do something they asked me why and they got into a back and forth with me about it. 

I just don’t know how to stop it. I’m not trying to be difficult or argumentative. I don’t know how to just accept it when he says, “you need to do this quest next” or tries to correct my running form (something I have asked him to do) and I don’t argue back or immediately get upset.

   Not to get deep into my childhood, but both of my parents used corporal punishment… and took it to the extreme at times (hands around my neck, visible marks, redness, etc). My relationship with my mother is strained as well (narcissism). Also possible CSAM.
    I don’t necessarily remember much, but I do remember being exposed to pornography at a younger age. Could this be the cause of my hyper-sexuality?

1j8g0hc,2025-03-11 07:33:00,Need to vent/ mental health bad day.,"Hi there,
I'm not trying to be a downer today, but I really need to vent or if there's anything advice, help yourself.

I just recently moved out of Oregon into Minnesota, it was a choice that I was mostly in, but also had some doubts about as well. And my partner who I'm with is not very good at trying to help with my mental support. Since she needs to get help herself. Like be more self aware. To put into other words, she's very oblivious and takes things to seriously, and jumps all over my helpful advice. Thinking she knows everything and I don't. Anyways, not trying to talk or be rude when I say that. We moved here about a week ago and everythings been so hard for me since change is hard for me. But this place seems so much more strict and straightforward, that I am honestly not used to. 

When we got here it was a stressful trip first off. Then I had a panic attack from not being able to find the place. Then had a big argument over the fact that I apparently am to needy, and that I need to ask for help when I need it. My partners words. (And yes I make mistakes too.) Then, I found out this place is haunted and has bad markings on the ceiling, (aka satanic stars) my animals don't like that room, I can feel everything watching me etc. then moving stuff into a 3rd floor apartment, that my other half decided to get, (again my fault for not working with that one.) And got into a few mild arguments, then yesterday and the day before that got worse, she got mad because my pet rat accidentally chewed a very important cord and that I didn't want to talk about it that very late morning, from no sleep and talking it out to, saying I need space, then she slammed the door on me, walked out before then and yelled at me saying, I wasn't making her feel important and that I care more about the animals, than her expensive stuff. (So I did it again made another mistake, yelled back and said that things are not as important than you, and that you (her) needs to calm down and take a break.) I cried my eyes out and picked up the chips and paper plate I throw from being mad. And we calmly talked about it later. But she still doesn't understand what she did wrong. And now I'm completely terrified to ask for anything or advice or help her with anything, because I'm always getting either yelled at or my opinions don't matter
Stuff matters more to her than people or animals.

So I tried to do the good mental health advice and take a break, but why do I feel horrible still? I feel so alone and terrified for my opinions and my feelings got horribly hurt. I'm trying to forgive, but I just wanna run away and never return a lot of the days. I know I have flaws too. And I did apologize on my part too. And I'm trying not to take on the responsibility of others feels, and be a good empathetic person as well. But I feel like everything I do on a day to day level, has got me even more stressed. And by the way (she's transgender, no judgements on my parts here and not trying to be rude when I say this.)
I feel this with her daily, since I have to explain everything detail, on how I'm feeling, to if I'm venting, to what do I mean about the simplest task, I do on a normal day to day level. Plus my cleaning up stresses her out, and my organization skills as well. I'm having to reteach her everything because no one taught her how to do anything.

1j8fzao,2025-03-11 07:31:22,SA and claustrophobia,"I have been mildly claustrophobic since I was a kid. Think scared of tight spaces such as in caves, will take the stairs over the lift etc., but really nothing bad - it caused me more discomfort and anxiety than outright panic.

Then a few years ago I went through a traumatic experience (SA). Since then I am noticeably worse. 

I realise it's not truly about small spaces for me at this point, it's to do with being unable to leave a small space. Or being unable to leave a space in general, get away from things and people. It's worse if it involves my body in any way, and smaller spaces are inherently closer to my body I guess. It's the lack of control that scares me.

I have poor physical health and have needed ultrasounds of different body parts, GI scopes that I refused out of fear, and coming up, an MRI of my brain, which really combines the small space and unable to leave/not in control fears together. In my mind, my claustrophobia is still mild, so I thought it would be uncomfortable and anxiety-inducing, but certainly manageable. Instead I was a mess leading up to it, despite talks with a lovely radiologist, and ultimately had to rearrange :(

The medical stuff is a bit beside the point tbh. I more want to know, does anyone relate to me in any way? Did improving your claustrophobia require confronting your trauma? If so, did that take a long time, and how did you handle things that triggered you in the meantime?

Just wanted to get this off my chest and hopefully someone can relate to how I’ve been feeling.

For the past 5 weeks I’ve had unrelenting feeling of despair, like something is wrong with me. After a health scare in Feb, it’s been CONSTANTLY on my mind and like my body immediately went into nonstop adrenal mode. I was going to work feeling like I had a serious medical issue going on, like chest tightness, in the shoulders and upper back. Fluctuating heart rate that I now take propranolol for. This unnerved feeling like something is wrong with me and I got stuck into constantly googling why I feel this way more so through Reddit. Agitations and fear that would come from feeling like I was gonna be left alone when someone would leave for work or go to bed. Sleep being hot garbage and multiple waking up during it. Constantly body scanning and getting frustrated that it wasn’t going away. At one point it was very hard to sit and do things like hobbies to get my mind off it like no interest in anything, feeling hungry but not caring enough to eat but forcing myself to do it. Excessive smoking. Then constantly seeking reassurance. It got so bad after a couple weeks it was hard to do Anything like stand still or sit still and focus, sometimes sleep is like that and it got worse. Depressive mode hard upon waking up. Wanting to go back to work but then having no real energy to which caused me to go off work for a while. Most of the times I’m just stuck laying in bed and googling for reassurance and then getting frustrated about that cause it’s getting repetitive which is further frustrating me. I’ve tried heavy excising and yoga and eating healthy and supplement taking. I feel normal but I don’t if that makes sense? It’s like my mind is constantly in this worry mode about my health and fearing of not getting any sleep. Then I wake up feeling like “another day of dealing with this shit again…”. It’s really hard to put into words how this feels. It’s like when I have conversations I don’t feel all that into them and I just get kinda annoyed about it. I also get paranoid if people think I’m sick and what people at my work are probably thinking. I had a lot of stressors in my life happen in the past year. And the fact that this bout of anxiety came back while I was at home is it possible my own home is making me subconsciously being reminded of all this? I’ve always had a fear of insomnia and I also been pretty much a light sleeper and someone who doesn’t like sleeping that much unless I’m really tired. Makes sense right?

- not wanting to wash my dishes/clean/take care of myself and my personal hygiene/cook
- Being constantly impatient with my family, coworkers, work clients, etc. Everything pisses me off so fast, I catch myself being rude sometimes 
- Isolating myself at home, not wanting to see anyone really
- Picking at my skin to the point it bleeds and hurts
- Feeling nauseous, especially in the morning 
- Easily overwhelmed

Always prioritize Good Sleep practices above all else, cannot stress this enough, most mental conditions will hamper your sleep patterns and this will always snowball into erratic brain chemestry and erroding emotional fortitude. Especially with teens who are experiencing hormonal changes and social upheaval in school, having a poor rest can be the difference between life or death. Personally I always suspected my poor sleep was affecting many aspects of my life and when mixed with my mental/emotional issues was driving me insane, when I talked to many therapists about this and my wish to be medicated with sleeping medicine I was many times (with good reason) told not to consume it (due to the various side effects and high rates of addiction). However after talking to a different psychiatrist I was finally recommended to consume this and other types of medication responsably. My life was completely changed and even though I still suffer from my conditions, of course, I can process my own emotions and thoughts in a more healthy and reasonable manner.

I have been on a self-improvement journey this past year and I've grown a lot, which had the unintended consequences of me changing many opinions, approaches, taste in music and film, and so much more...

I just don't feel attraction to anything negative and don't have any interest in talking about negative things that are outside of my control.

It has empowered me to get a job that enables me to help others in tangible ways and to volunteer...

The issue is that it feels like I'm very out of sync with so many people in my life but I appreciate those people and think they are lovely....

I just feel like I will want them to change with me and I know you cannot make someone change and trying to change people is controlling!

However, I'm afraid of making new friends because I'm still working through my social anxiety and wondering what I can do that might help with the social anxiety because just exposing myself to anxiety-provoking social situations has actually only made my anxiety much worse and it re-traumatized me!

Now that I’ve grown up and been in a stable house with my dad and new mom, I have felt this odd inkling that I can’t be normal. I feel dysfunctional in this house. While I have been accomplishing a lot lately, I still feel like it’s not enough. And to my parents, I have nothing to feel this stressed about. They say, ‘your life is good now, you have nothing to be concerned over’ or ‘you’re 20, go be a normal 20 year old and have fun’. I feel like I don’t know how to let go and be that? My anxiety bars me from a lot but I still have friends and participate in things, just less frequently due to exhaustion, work, and school. I don’t know what to do and now I’m having the second meltdown this week crying in my room because I can’t just be the person I want to that’s out partying or dating and doing what college kids do. I’m plagued by irrational fears that I’m not real and I’m just going through the motions of life. I just want to know if I’m alone? I feel so isolated and dismissed. I don’t know how to snap out of it. I want to be comfortable in myself without being worried every 5 minutes about if I have some brain tumor or if I have BPD. Is it common for quiet BPD to manifest like this or am I being a hypochondriac?

1j8enua,2025-03-11 06:26:53,Has anyone else had a problem with this?,"I am a 15 year old living in australia and last night i was crying all night and didn’t go to sleep untill 5am. I belive i was having panic attacks and felt i needed to talk to someone so i searched up 24/7 chat lines as it was 3am and i couldn’t talk on the phone. I tried beyond blue first and it took me 15 minutes to get to a councillor when i was the first and only person in the waitlist. i am not too pressed about this as it was early in the morning and they may not have had many people working. I talked to them for around 5 minutes and they did absolutely nothing. they addressed the problem and then told me to go to sleep. I didn’t know what to do so i just said thank you and ended the chat. I understand it may be hard but telling me to go to sleep isn’t what a helpline should do. I was sent into another panicked state and i still wanted to talk to someone so i looked at my options and the only one left was lifeline or a men’s mental health service (which i do not quite qualify for as i am a girl). I turned to lifeline scared that i was wasting their time as it wasn’t ’life threatening’ but i was desperate. this time it took me 20 minutes to even get into the chatrooom as the bot kept failing and saying the service wasn’t available. i was frantic, a crazy crying mess. I kept trying and it finally worked but took another 10 minutes to connect me to a councillor who again didn’t help. I felt as if i was taking up their time, the councillor took ages to respond to each of my messages and would just say very vague and unhelpful statements about my situation. Eventually i got sick of being treated like a burden when i bravely reached out to them, which is something i don’t normally do. I don’t understand how people can claim we have a mental health crisis at the moment when the services that are supposed to support and be a place to go to are pretty much useless. I hope that it is only me that has had this problem before but it really needs to be better.

1j83nln,2025-03-10 22:37:14,What if I'm just an emotionally abusive person ?,"I don't know why but I always feel the need to control everything. If something isn't done perfectly how I imagined it to be, it will send me spiraling. Palpitation, anxiety, burst of emotions including anger, it terrifies me. It's manageable when it's in regard of things that are entirely in my control, but it becomes a problem when someone else is included.

I recently made a Minecraft world with my little brother. I love playing with him, and it has been such a huge work on myself to not freak out when he just plays like he wants to. I think I accidentally hurted him today tho. We found a geode that was half in glitched lava. I asked him to not touch it as it looked pretty cool, but he didn't hear me and accidentally released the lava everywhere, which made me lose my entire inventory to it.

I know it's such a stupid thing to freak out over, but I felt genuinely sick and struggled holding back tears. He was apologizing and trying to cheer me up, which makes me feel even more like an awful manipulative big brother. He ended up agreeing to deleting this save and starting over, since we lost more than half of our things, but I'm scared that he could've accepted it only because he felt my pain. I did my best to hide how much it destroyed me, but I think it wasn't enough.

I just hate myself so much for letting my emotions ruin a good afternoon over such a non-issue, I'm terrified of myself and I don't know how to control my emotions better.

Phone addiction it's been really killing me for EXTREMELY long time, and i feel like i mentally just can't keep up with myself and neither with this.It started when i was young and it developed as more time passed throughout my life,and since i was pretty lonely kid my phone it's been the only thing that was there to keep me company and as someone might guess that slowly grew into addiction which just turned into depression.And now im stuck in a life i don't want for myself that i cannot just leave because it grew too much into my being and core,and besides that it's the only thing i have really.

Now yeah i know that most people would currently suggest just blocking all apps and use phone for what phones are usually meant to,and maybe do some hobby i always wanted or get some work done.But the thing is i really don't have anything outside of it,no friends whom i can hang out with,no hobbies besides writing my mind out on a pice of paper and certainty no sports where i do something.Yes my whole day just revolves around laying around besides when i have to go to school,but i never wanted that and on several occasions i've tried to change but i just can't.I watched every motivational video and ones about how to leave the phone,read everything online yet my mind just refuses to do what i want it to do and i truly feel hopeless.

Funny thing about this is that i want to become a video editor but i easily just drift out on tik tok meanwhile trying to find content and inspiration as well as material to work with,and my phone addiction with that hobby clearly doesn't align at all which is just cherry on top.If anyone had this problem i would like to hear what you did against all odds that im currently facing,and i would be so grateful if it works because my attention span along with rot i received with this stupid device is just too strong for me tho i am willing to cooperate.",mentalhealth,1,0,Capital_Drag46,twdepression know kinds things would hire psychiatrist something sadly isnt option reasons really sharei want find alike experienced people way phone addiction really killing extremely long time feel like mentally cant keep neither thisit started young developed time passed throughout lifeand since pretty lonely kid phone thing keep company someone might guess slowly grew addiction turned depressionand im stuck life dont want leave grew much coreand besides thing really yeah know people would currently suggest blocking apps use phone phones usually meant toand maybe hobby always wanted get work donebut thing really dont anything outside itno friends hang withno hobbies besides writing mind pice paper certainty sports somethingyes whole day revolves around laying around besides go schoolbut never wanted several occasions ive tried change canti watched every motivational video ones leave phoneread everything online yet mind refuses want truly feel hopeless funny thing want become video editor easily drift tik tok meanwhile trying find content inspiration well material work withand phone addiction hobby clearly doesnt align cherry topif anyone problem would like hear odds im currently facingand would grateful works attention span along rot received stupid device strong tho willing cooperate

Not to get too personal with it, but they do vent about their mental health a lot. I have no issue with that aspect, but then they also start RANTING on their story which I would also usually have no issue with, it’s just HOW they rant.

I remember one story of theirs said something basically along the lines of “If you use C.ai at all for homework or any personal connection I’m literally better than you.” and then a continuous rant about how people who use C.ai in any capacity are “Retards”. Mind you, these people don’t affect this person AT ALL. And then today, they also posted on their story how people who like a certain cringy song on Tiktok are losers and how “they’re up!”.

This is what they typed;

“They on tiktok saying U can't hate on this if you like cringe shit yourself but at least my cringe shit is good i'm not white im not 12 and im not a cis bisexual dude in his late 20's talking about some

My neurodivergence is better than yours. I'm the goat. You just float.”

I get it’s a joke, but it gets to a point when your WHOLE personality is just hatred filled. But that just leads me to the question, do they even care?

1j8cpye,2025-03-11 04:55:03,Positive affirmations,"Apologies if this goes against the guidelines. Admins please remove it if thats the case.
Otherwise read on 😊

Hi everyone, I’ve been working on a positive affirmations app that I released not so long ago. I haven’t been advertising it yet, so you have the honors to be one of the first ones to use it. The idea behind the app is to swipe through positive affirmations just like swiping on TikTok or Instagram Reels. Doing this consistently on a daily basis has proven to shift your way of thinking and mindset for the better.
What makes this app worth to try it out:
1. You can choose one or multiple categories for your affirmations (ex. Love, Fight depression, Motivation etc.)
2. To make this more interesting, you can choose a Theme for your app, practically your choose a background and you can customize your affirmations text appearance (size, color, font etc).
3. Mirror feature where you can read positive affirmations while you look at yourself to boost your confidence 
4. Four different fully customizable widgets.
5. There are categories and themes that are completely free, unlockables that you can unlock by watching a quick ad, and there’s also Premium content in case you want to subscribe and get the full experience.
6. Ads and rewards: You watch an ad only if you want to unlock something. The app doesn’t have intrusive ads or banners. You are in full control.

Most of the other similar apps just give you one category and limited affirmations, not to mention the annoying amount of ads. With Blumli you get about 20 free and unlockable categores combined, which gives you a potential of 20.000 positive affirmations without paying anything!

PS. If you actually install it, keep an eye out during Easter, Christmas, Halloween, Valentines etc. - limited holiday themes available just for a week or two! 😉

1j8cgu5,2025-03-11 04:43:46,My mom needs help - depression & alcoholism,"My mom has battled depression for most of her life beginning from when she had her first baby. With medication, she’s been able to live a normal, happy life up until recently when things took a downfall. In the past year, she’s begun going through menopause and the hormone imbalances have caused her depression to be the worst it’s ever been.

Her coping mechanism when things get bad is alcohol which in my opinion has become more of an issue than the depression itself. She’s constantly sneaking drinks and hiding it from my dad/ the rest of the family and I’ve recently caught her putting vodka in her orange juice at 7am. Because she’s on medication for depression and anxiety, the effects of alcohol are way worse often causing her to lash out, be rude to friends/family and overall it’s caused her to lose many friends over the years. Despite all this, she won’t admit that she has a problem with drinking and when I’ve asked her if she’d consider quitting, she tells me it’s the only thing that numbs the pain.

Lately, she’s been having major anger episodes where something as little as my dad looking at her funny will cause intense rage, leading to her yelling, breaking things in the house, and hitting/throwing things at him. My dad is an absolute saint and somehow manages to keep calm and put up with all these years, but I can tell he’s at the point where he doesn’t know what to do anymore.

She’s recently started seeing a new psychiatrist who has been great, however I’m 99% sure that she doesn’t tell her about her alcohol issues. I worry that the mixture of alcohol & medication is dangerous and possibly amplifying her condition. I feel that her psychiatrist should know that she is a heavy drinker as I feel that should be taken account when prescribing medication. Is there any way that I can contact her psychiatrist without my mom knowing?

1j86vp9,2025-03-11 00:48:53,Depressed wife with gambling problem (likely due to Abilify),"My wife has a gambling problem that is either caused or exacerbated by her prescription use of Abilify to treat her depression. I've done what I can to limit the financial damage she can inflict on us, though she still has access to her own credit cards (and claims none of the ones she has left have a cash advance option, or does not have physical cards for the ones that do). 

She receives a monthly disability payment from the government, out of which she is able to pay half our mortgage/taxes/homeowners insurance (escrow), and half the car payment for the car that she drives (she uses it >95% of the time, me <5%). I pay for everything else. I could afford to pay for the house and car also, but I feel like it is important that she be invested in our financial success halfsies on the two most important debts we carry.

She thinks this is unfair, but I know (based on our 9 year history together) that if she wasn't giving me that money every month, she'd just blow it at the casino anyway. Like she did last month--despite the fact that she knew that money was to be paid to me for half the mortage and half the car payment. Two months at the end of last year that money had to go to pay down her credit cards which she had run up gambling, also. 

So, this is an ongoing problem, and not getting better despite the things I have tried: only bring cash to the casino rule, yelling, sulking, being nice--none of makes a difference, no matter what I do.

She refuses to stop taking Abilify for fear of the depression being uncontrollable on other medications. It took her a couple of years to find the right mix of medications, including Abilify, that made her feel like she could function again.

I love my wife and do not intend to leave her over this.

1j8c1i1,2025-03-11 04:26:01,The state of my physical health is affecting my mental health,"Hello, recently I visited the doctor for some random problems, which turned out to be pretty serious. All my life I had back pain and I knew I had scoliosis for a long time, but this time I got so scared. After nearly a week of deadlines and projec6t and sitting at the laptop all day long, I've noticed I'm seriously tilted. The doctor said it's scoliosis, lordosis and kyphosis. That's right, the whole pack of back problems, I feel like a 3 in 1 nescafe coffe. 

Then, my shoulder started to sting all of a sudden, I couldn't even lift my arm. Even the doctor didn't know why it appeared all of a sudden. At the ecografy, they listed a lot of problems, and said the problem wa always tgere, but the pain appeared just now. 

They all told me what to do: exercises, pilates, stretching. I didn't really pay much attentions to it, nor that I have time to do all those things. But recently I got sick, just a regular cold. The problem is no medicine I own seems to work, and I don't have the money for new one. I can't put my lenses on while sick, so i can't see anything at a distance longer than half a meter.  The worst back pain (a different type, which I haven't fekt before) just attacked me all of a sudden. 

And im so afraid these problem would bother me more in the future. I'm so tired of always having something to worry about in my body. I'm so sick of a new day when something new is hurting. It's so not fair some poeple just exist in this world without any healt3 issue.

I know I should do my pilates and  stretching, but I'm so unmotivated and right now just overwhelmed, and I'm crying. Everything just attacked me all of a sudden. I know it sounds really bad but I'm so afraid of becoming unable to do common things because those pains will become chronic.

It got to the point where even in school, I get bullied for simply being Indian, online aswell even more ! It’s not like I chose this life, I already had a lot of stuff going on, i have extremely low self confidence because of not only this but also my “friends” comparing me to models. I don’t care about that? I’m sorry I was born like this? You dokt have to remind me every day that I am not attractive. You don’t have to always talk about females and how they are attracted to you. I don’t care. 

It’s gotten to the point where I have suicidal thoughts on the daily, every night while i’m in bed I just can’t help but remember that I don’t have a girlfriend or I’m not conventionally attractive or that i get called out for literal existing at times. I’m sorry i was born this way.

on top of all that, my grades are slipping, i lose motivation to do any school work and it’s ruining not just my present but i’m sure my future. I don’t want to be broke when i’m older, I need to get my life in order, i’ll be 16 this year and i’m falling behind on all my studies. 

I don’t like going outside because i have developed social anxiety and I am always thinking about what others think about me and if they think i’m ugly because of my friends constantly talking about looks and facial features. I don’t think i can keep going like this, I know all of this sounds so stupid and unimportant but to me it’s a really big deal.

The only friend that I actually loved hanging out with and i think truly liked me for me was my ex, she was so perfect and she never brought up anyrhing bad about my looks, even when I was feeling down. I forgot all about everyone else when I was with her, she was so perfect and it was like she was the female version of me. Not only this but I also met her at a time where i had no friends, literally. So i think that made me grow attached to her even more, because she didn’t care if i was weird or a loser. 

It all sound so stupid and small but when it gets to the point where i’m daily thinking about this stuff and how i’m ruining my future and everyone else’s feelings by just being around them it really makes me want to just end it.

1j7ke82,2025-03-10 04:36:45,Mourning the life that doesn’t exist because you never got helped as a child.,"Over the last 2.5 years I have been working with my doctor to try to figure out why my sleep is so bad. It’s always been bad, but became disabling after I turned 40. I’ll explain more of this in a moment but this started my healing.

When I was 13, I got into a lot of trouble, I struggled in school and became violent. This was back in the 90s where bullying wasn’t taken seriously and I was often told to be the bigger person while my bully never got into trouble. The first time I hit someone and they feared me instead of pitying me, and the bullying stopped. I felt like I finally had power over the situation. Teachers weren’t helping, neither were my parents.

Fighting ultimately led to me being arrested and I was put into juvenile detention, I was court ordered to see a psychiatrist for an evaluation, I was put in a hospital. My father pulled me out after it was done and they told me they said I was “a spoiled brat.” My family never spoke of this again until I was in my 30s right before my dad passed away, he confessed I was diagnosed with adhd. Even then I wasn’t sure what to do with that information.

My entire life has been one struggle after another. So many poor choices, homelessness, not being able to hold a job, huge parts of my life I don’t even remember. I feel like I blinked and went from 20 to 30.

I met my husband 14 years ago, and he had his own issues too but we overcame, we pulled ourselves out of hell. He’s mostly to thank for that but he’s stayed with me through all of my issues, and loves me. He is amazing in so many ways. However, my health and mental state were starting to wear on him too. I still couldn’t hold down jobs, the longest job I’ve had is 2 years. He was getting fed up. I started seeing my current doctor.

So, I'm working with my doctor. I can’t sleep, I go for weeks on 3 hours of sleep. I get treated for insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Lots of medications and lots of nasty side effects. I had other health issues and she has fixed each one as they come up. Ive become healthier overall.

She suggested testing me for mood disorders like bipolar, and that's when it hit me and I remembered what my father had told me about my adhd diagnosis. I told her about that and she typed on her little computer and asked me like 20 questions. I scored 16/20. She said she’s confident enough to diagnose me with inattentive adhd. She prescribed me some medicine and I went home and took it.

At first, I cried. I cried because it felt like someone had removed the iron plate that's been sitting on my head my entire life. All of a sudden things were quiet, I could think about one thing instead of jumping all around. I could finish my train of thought. I felt more relaxed at that moment than I ever have in my entire life. I cried for hours. Then. I slept. I slept for 7 hours. I slept!

Then it hit me. Would I have chosen path A instead of path B if I had just got help when I was a kid? Would I be in a high paying senior position somewhere making 6 figures right now? Would I have followed my dream and been an oceanographer or possibly a nurse? 

All of the what ifs hit me hard, and then I mourned that person. I felt so alone, and betrayed. I grew angry at my father and mother all over again. I’ve come to accept it. I am who I am, I can just move forward. I have the job I have at amazon because of untreated adhd. I look the way I do because of untreated ADHD. Right now though, I am happy I can sleep.

Being a motivated person, I am finding this depressing and need an optimal way to recover. I am talking to a therapist and considering taking a medical leave to pursue a solo retreat.

As I've not previously done a solo retreat, I'd really appreciate insights on the right experience. I spent some time researching and would really appreciate suggestions.

* Guided sessions with meditation and mindfulness that help me reset.
* A retreat that involves nature immersion with fresh air and lush trees.
* Ability to spend time in solitude with a program that's not too rigid.
* Enjoy a scenic view of a body of water (lake/ocean).
* Ideal time duration of 7-10 days.
* *Not* prioritizing a luxury resort that includes spa, massages, etc. -- these are nice-to-haves.

1j88v46,2025-03-11 02:13:04,How to live with yourself without spiralling out of control?,"Sorry if it's all over the place it's late and I just needed to get it out I guess. 

I realised that I can't live without distractions. I always have to have my headphones listening to music, watching a YouTube video or just scrolling on socials. Even while playing a game I need something in the background because I can't sit with myself at all. 
Some time ago I went to see a therapist on my campus because i had an urgent situation. She made me start a journal and told me to write everything i was feeling and to take photos of anything that made me feel positive emotions. I tried living more ""in the moment"" observing things, people letting myself just feel and eliminating the distractions at least a little. I tried taking photos but no matter how pretty something was it still made me extremely depressed. I think she hoped that things would get better with me but it just made everything worse. During this time I was a lot more anxious and overwhelmed than usual, cried more often over stupid things where usually I'm just numb.
I had moments when the sun was a little too bright and it made me feel that something was extremely wrong and I didn't understand why other people didn't share my paranoia. Feeling like I don't belong is nothing new for me but during this time I didn't feel human at all. I didn't have the energy to get out of bed and to talk to people. I started having a lot of intense and obsessive thoughts about harming myself in gruesome and specific ways. It came to the point where I slept with a knife on my bedside table for weeks. I knew I wasn't going to do anything with but I felt like I have to have it next to me. And that's just a few of the examples of whatever was happening.
I thought about making an appointment and trying to ask for meds if there's a possibility. I don't even know if they would be able to help me at all. No therapists ever diagnosed/ prescribed me anything and I feel like if something was really wrong they would already do it.

1j49jkf,2025-03-05 23:38:33,I Miss My Girlfriend,"TW: mental health, SA, SH

I (30M) have been with my gf (27F) for 8 years. We've had our ups and downs, but it's always been okay. I've struggled with all sorts of mental health in this time - depression, anxiety, ADHD - but my gf has always been fine. Maybe would have benefitted from an antidepressant, but nowhere near bad.

A while ago she started therapy and uncovered some repressed memories. These have been corroborated to be real by her brother (31M). Since then, she has suffered nightmares, flashbacks, and has been diagnosed with CPTSD DID. Also since this time, we have become distant. She goes to sleep around 4-5am when I wake up, and she doesn't really spend time with me. When she does, she's not really present.

I understand, to the best of my ability, that it's difficult for her. This isn't something that has voluntarily happened to her. She isn't having a good time. Her alters cause her to self harm (which she had never done since we'd been together, I had SH before her and I met). I just miss when she felt like my partner. I still try to go out of my way for her, but sometimes she doesn't even acknowledge me doing stuff for her. Which to be fair, she isn't asking for. I've always gone out of my way for attention from others, but no matter what I try I can get very little from her. She's very averse to touching, sometimes she wants sex, but otherwise doesn't really want to touch.

I just miss when I felt loved. She tells me she loves me sometimes, when she's more present, but other than that I don't feel it. I miss physical touch. I miss feeling wanted and important. I miss having someone who made me a better person. And when I try to politely tell her these things, she reminds me that she's trying. She wants to be better. She's going to therapy 2-4 times/week

I'm struggling so hard with my own mental health right now. The only thing I can do is wait, and I've always been awful at waiting (I'm sure it'sthe ADHD). I can't do anything to make it better. It feels like it's going to be endless, then I spiral into thoughts of suicide that I haven't had in a long time. I am also in therapy, once every other week. My own mental health goes up and down like a rollercoaster, lately.

Idk, I just need some encouraging words. I feel trapped. I have a good job, a nice house, a nice car, I feel like things should be good, but I'm not happy. I don't enjoy my hobbies. I only work out and make food it feels like. Luckily we have 4 dogs so I do get a lot of cuddles and affection from them, which I think helps significantly.

1il4d7d,2025-02-09 07:53:33,I just want to feel happy again,"It's been over a year now since the last time I felt truly happy.

End of January last year, I broke up with my girlfriend. Everyone who saw how she treated me in-person told me that she was bad for me and that her promises to change and do better were clearly all hollow, so I mustered up enough strength and ended things. She threatened suicide, kept me at her beckoned call for about three weeks, and then rubbed her new boyfriend in my face before cutting contact. All of that was done and over by February 25th, 2024. 

I've been a completely miserable person to be around since then, evidenced by the fact that I've lost all but one of my friends, in-person and online. I have all of one friend that I can talk to, we live near each other but she can never hang out because of her strict parents and schedule. 

My best friends gave up on me, decided out of the blue that I wasn't a good friend anymore and stopped talking to me. I've been lying to my parents telling them I'm going to hang out with them and then just going out by myself because I don't want my family knowing what a loser I've become.

Life has just been a cycle of work, school, and losing friends. I'm constantly afraid that my grades will slip or my hours at work will get cut and I feel so alone that it actually physically hurts. I'm completely starved of human connection and interaction. I just want someone to hold me and tell me everything is somehow going to be okay. I want to cry. I want to scream. How could everything go so wrong in a year? It all started with breaking up with my ex.

1idpus1,2025-01-30 21:15:34,Feeling bad about work...,"Just putting my feels on words to get them out, but if someone has some kind words for me I will be happy.

I have been double working since November. I want to quit my old job but am afraid to in case the new job does not last.

Been at the old one for 6 years now and it is 80% good, but one task and one co-worker just keeps me down. Changing tasks is not an option, I asked. Also, there is no chance to grow, and there have been no raises in the last 3 years.

New job as a content mod pays better, it is less work, easier work, more benefits, and has better hours. But my anxiety is making me wary that it may not last.

I believe they may have hired more people than they needed for the task (6 where 4 would do), and sometimes we clear our queue of work by Wednesday, and Thursday and Friday are easier, where we refresh the queues every couple minutes to see new entries to moderate. I am the sole responsible for handling appeals right now, so that's something to give confidence, but still...

Is it normal for companies to let people go under a year after hiring? Are WFH content moderation positions usually like this? This is my first experience in the field.

Maybe I am just overthinking too much?

TLDR, my fear is that I leave my old job after 6 and a half years just for the new one to not last until the end of the year, and I find myself jobless. No particular indication of that happening tho...

The plan now is to carry on double working until July, save some money, then kit old job if the new one is still going strong.

Not the worse situation of the world, I know, but I am still hitting myself over it...

1hyjxgh,2025-01-11 06:20:48,I'm starting to believe I absolutely need therapy *Long*,"This is a very lengthy story, so I'll try sum it up in places. I'll also say that there is a bit of a trigger warning throughout

I grew up depressed; I never really got on super well with my family never once told I did a good job or that they were proud of me, I was often overlooked for my older sister. As the years went on even my friends at school started to bully me for the fun of it as I don't defend myself, when I was 15 one evening we were hanging out where we got mugged and I came out the worst of it with multiple broken fingers after over a hour of us being beat up by two older guys (Our hands were smashed on a post by a wooden log, this was back in 2011) 

Afterward I became a recluse, my friends mocked me so I backed off completely, it broke my trust so I just didn't speak to anyone, legitimately I spent the whole summer basically locked away in my room afraid to even walk outside. I ended up managing to go to college re-do my exams, but I never had any meaningful friendship from that, my family felt I'd just ""get over"" what happened so I never actually got help instead wallowed in my own self-pity refusing to try. 

Over the next 10 years I spent mainly alone. I had one or two relationships come my early on around 2013 but I've not really had anyone since, I managed to eventually get a job but I just spent all the money to just try fill that gap in my life to feel happy again, I was overweight, sad, and alone, so I eventually got into twitch streaming to just try make friends which has made me meet some fantastic people I still call friends to this day, though I'm just not close to them as much as I'd want to

In late 2021 I decided to go to University to do what I wanted to attend a few years ago for which was Film Production, I couldn't go when I wanted as my family didn't support me at all, hell even my own dad told me to kill myself even thinking of it. I didn't care much for actually doing the course, I just wanted to leave my home life, the fire inside of me has been dead for many years now, hell I even said to myself when submitting that by the end of these three years I'd off myself if i don't feel better, and I'm nearly at the end of my three years. 

A few months ago though I met someone through a course aquaintence, mainly because all three of us stream but right off the bat it felt like fireworks, it felt like I found someone that truely understood me for me. We got close to dating even confessed to eachother we liked eachother but stuff got in the way timing wise so we kept as friends, I introduced her to my friend group as well but throughout even my friends noted I looked so much happier, she helped me find that spark I've been looking for, hell she actually indirectly made me push to be a better person. I did let my demons take over behind the scenes, as since I met her i often went to my friends telling them about her my thoughts my feelings everything 

November came around and she asked to go on a walk just us two, it took me by suprise but honestly it felt incredible, it felt like there was motion by her to push our friendship forward into potentially a relationship and it felt incredible. I did a stupid thing towards the end that made her uncomfortable, nothing serious but that paired with her learning what I have told a few friends about her made her back off completely for the last two months, and frankly I was devestated 

It felt like everything came crashing back down; I started missing deadlines with university, i started missing classes along with meetings, hell even on occasion I wasn't there in friends streams as since she's there I felt like i had nowhere i can turn to, things did get better and I managed to mask the pain I had since my friends got concerned, she went from cold to that we'll need to have a talk then to actually lets not as it'll cause a lot of issues across the friend group, instead just asking for some space between us and let things fix naturally, so I did my best to just leave her be 

Few weeks back about mid December I set up a multiplayer stream between myself and a lot of mutual friends (I'm primarily a single player streamer, i just find it more comfortable) to celebrate a milestone, she becomes pretty friendly towards me trying to speak to me so we started talking again which made me so much happier, but I saw that she in-fact has a new job coming but she is actually moving out of the city as soon as the first week of Febuary, which I won't lie devestated me. 

Thing is though I know because of my shit past because I've had a lot of trust broken by people I thought were friends she's the first one that I just natuarally took down those walls for, I latched my feelings onto her as for the first time in god knows how long she made me feel worthy, she calms my brain in such a way I don't think anyone else has even come close to. Though she is moving she has told me she will be back here once a week for university (Shes redoing two modules she failed last year) so we get the chance to hang out, she's not said anything reguarding seeing eachother though

From my trauma I know i picked up a lot of shitty coping mechanisms; one friend I used to be closer to said to me that I put her on a pedistal above absolutely everyone else and that's true I do, but I just don't know how to open myself up more after the shit I've been through. I feel like i have way too many issues to count, and honestly I just want to be happy, I miss having that fire within me ",MMFB,7,2,ThrowawaySteve33,lengthy story ill try sum places ill also say bit trigger warning throughout grew depressed never really got super well family never told good job proud often overlooked older sister years went even friends school started bully fun dont defend one evening hanging got mugged came worst multiple broken fingers hour us beat two older guys hands smashed post wooden log back afterward became recluse friends mocked backed completely broke trust didnt speak anyone legitimately spent whole summer basically locked away room afraid even walk outside ended managing go college redo exams never meaningful friendship family felt id get happened never actually got help instead wallowed selfpity refusing try next years spent mainly alone one two relationships come early around ive really anyone since managed eventually get job spent money try fill gap life feel happy overweight sad alone eventually got twitch streaming try make friends made meet fantastic people still call friends day though im close much id want late decided go university wanted attend years ago film production couldnt go wanted family didnt support hell even dad told kill even thinking didnt care much actually course wanted leave home life fire inside dead many years hell even said submitting end three years id dont feel better im nearly end three years months ago though met someone course aquaintence mainly three us stream right bat felt like fireworks felt like found someone truely understood got close dating even confessed eachother liked eachother stuff got way timing wise kept friends introduced friend group well throughout even friends noted looked much happier helped find spark ive looking hell actually indirectly made push better person let demons take behind scenes since met often went friends telling thoughts feelings everything november came around asked go walk us two took suprise honestly felt incredible felt like motion push friendship forward potentially relationship felt incredible stupid thing towards end made uncomfortable nothing serious paired learning told friends made back completely last two months frankly devestated felt like everything came crashing back started missing deadlines university started missing classes along meetings hell even occasion wasnt friends streams since shes felt like nowhere turn things get better managed mask pain since friends got concerned went cold well need talk actually lets itll cause lot issues across friend group instead asking space us let things fix naturally best leave weeks back mid december set multiplayer stream lot mutual friends im primarily single player streamer find comfortable celebrate milestone becomes pretty friendly towards trying speak started talking made much happier saw infact new job coming actually moving city soon first week febuary wont lie devestated thing though know shit past ive lot trust broken people thought friends shes first one natuarally took walls latched feelings onto first time god knows long made feel worthy calms brain way dont think anyone else even come close though moving told back week university shes redoing two modules failed last year get chance hang shes said anything reguarding seeing eachother though trauma know picked lot shitty coping mechanisms one friend used closer said put pedistal absolutely everyone else thats true dont know open shit ive feel like way many issues count honestly want happy miss fire within
1huo8rd,2025-01-06 07:47:03,Long story,"In Elementary through early high school I was bullied. I was always the tiny quiet white kid so I was a target for bullying that wasn't exactly severe but it was continuous for most of my life. I think this has been the root of much of my issues. 

One I got into high school I always had a deep need for connection and yearning. After COVID we came back and I got into a big friend group. I didn't realize how bad of an influence many of those kids were at the time because I was still a dumb teen like we all were, but I expectedly got into trouble due to hanging out with them. 

I started skipping classes, got into fights, got obsessed with following drama. I never had friends like that, that at the time seemed great because they were the only people in my life to give me lots of ""respect"" and affection.

I hungout with the group before and sometimes after school, at the parking lot across the street. It was a big group, probably the biggest group of the school. If you were in it, you knew almost everyone and almost everyone knew you. Until I met them, I never had any meaningful connections with people. I never had a girlfriend until then, only had a few friends every grade at the most.



I have had a severe feeling of loneliness for years. This resulted in a lot of embarrassing moments. For one example; a girl in the group that I was friends with, who I'll call A. I had a crush on A and developed an obsessive relationship that makes me cringe so much when I look back on it. 

Whenever she wouldn't answer my texts immediately, I would fly into a silent rage and yelled at her one time through text. This whole thing caused some of the group to be divided over my reactions to everything, some thought (knew) I overreacted to put it lightly. Some got her to apologize to me which was bs.

When A started dating one of my friends, I got jealous. I wanted to be with her so bad that I got nightmares of her having sex with him, and was always scared that they would end up doing it. When I eventually found out they did, my heart was pounding and I got depressed over it. 

Eventually I got over it and didn't care anymore once the relationship wasn't relevant to me and there was never a chance. Also she cheated on her boyfriend so I dodged a bullet there. Though I guess she also dodged me, to be fair. 

I think this whole obsession towards being with someone and whatnot, started in 8th grade. There was this one girl who had a crush on me so hard that she basically sexually harassed me the whole year. I won't go into detail here, the stories with her are kind of funny thinking about it, but if the roles were reversed I'd be getting a teacher's meeting lol.

At first I didn't like her but after while I developed a crush, obsessing and fantasizing over her. Never got with her obviously, but all of that must have awakened something in me because I never even cared about relationships or sex until that point.



In Junior year of HS, there was another girl in the group. She was a crazy goth chick, who I'll call Z. She hated men and wanted them to go extinct, yet she got ran through by half the guys in the school. She started drama and fights with all of her exes and claimed all of her 300 exes were abusive or rapists. To be fair to myself, most of this info I didn't know until long after I broke up with her, but the red flags were still bright and waving in the sky. I was so desperate for love that I accepted when she asked me out.

Z was my first girlfriend and sadly my first kiss. I was so unused to affection that whenever any girl would hug me I would freeze and my mind would short-circuit. She found out about my lack of affection so she put up some type of act about caring about me, she made it her job to always give me affection (hugs, forehead kisses). Looking back I know she just did all that to make her last ex (who I was friends with at the time) jealous. But then that all got me hooked onto not just her but that friend group.

It didn't take long for drama to start. Basically, one of her exes apparently raped her once and after they broke up he kept following her around like a lost puppy, also his sister was talking about killing everyone in the group. This was all her words because she was yapping to the group about this. So what decision do I automatically take? I want to fight the guy 🤣. At this time I wasn't dating Z or even liked her, we were just acquaintances. I knew the fight was a stupid decision, and I kept debating with myself if I should be doing that or not, kept thinking on how to get away with it.

Some force kept making me ignore the rational thinking. Looking back, it was clearly because due to my past of being bullied, my life was riddled with experiences of being put down and made to feel weak. That fight was my chance to finally earn respect and feel tough like everyone else. So I went for it. Me and some of the group waited to catch him outside one day, and one day we finally did, but I hesitated and he ran away. I spent that whole week building up a false confidence to fight him. Then, one other day, we finally caught him off guard at a location across the street.

He was sitting at a bench and I went over and punched him and the fight started. It was a pretty boring fight, I threw haymakers every once in awhile and chased him as he tried to run away. I never even noticed because the memory is so blurry but he was actually throwing punches, I couldn't tell because the dude was comically weak but he was actually hitting me with his phone. He was one of the football players at the school so he finally hit me with a little tackle and we fell to the ground. 

For some reason even though he had me on the ground, he just sat there and let me punch his face in from the ground. Two girls came over, held him up and positioned him for me to punch him again. Jumping is pussy as hell but I was blinded by anger so I hit him one more time. I walked over to the group and noticed some looking at me in horror as I felt something cold on my forehead. 

Since he used his phone as a weapon on me, I got cut on the head and was bleeding like crazy, I looked like I got shot in the face. But despite all that I was smiling because I felt I was going to get a lot of so-called respect from it. The scar on my forehead healed and is no longer visible but I still have a wonky looking finger from my bad punching form.

I became a bit of a celebrity in the group and let it all go to my head. When I started dating Z, it was just weeks until drama happened again. That friend that I mentioned earlier who was one of her exes, he got into some goofy drama with her so I went through the same motions as the last time, it was just deja vu on steroids. I knew that fighting him wasn't a good idea but I did it anyways.

However this fight was different. I didn't lose exactly but we both basically looked like toddlers fighting. It was embarassing and the respect I had immediately disappeared. Even people who weren't in that group or had anything to do with the fight ditched me or just changed personalities out of nowhere.

 There were two ""friends"" I had that acted normal with me until that fight, then all of a sudden they started picking on me, constantly belittling me and bragging about how I'm small and they'd send me to the hospital if we ever fought because they were at least 100 pounds heavier. It was non-stop.

I broke up with Z right after the fight. While I brought the entire situation on myself when you think about it, the sheer domino effect that resulted from that situation still affects me now.



I became extremely insecure about my ability to fight and defend myself. I became untrusting, wary, and angry at people around me. I got obsessed with following martial arts and wanted to be a magically unstoppable god because I didn't like that anybody on Earth could beat me in a fight. I know this all sounds like a supervillain backstory but this was my mind. 

I would get angry at seeing violence in media where someone gets beat up when they didn't deserve it. I hate words like ""ass beating"", ""ass whooping"", ""ass kicking"". I hate words like that because I know what it's like to be in a vulnerable spot like that and to have people say you ""Got your ass beat"", especially if you were a victim, is extremely hurtful but I've never heard of anyone having that same pet peeve as me. It makes me feel alone. 

I wanted to go to the gym, bulk up, and get into fighting. It became a daily obsession that I couldn't get over. I didn't have the drive to actually hit the gym so I just gained an appetite after getting onto a blue-collar job and went from 120 pounds to 160 in a few years. After the next relationship and inevitable breakup, I lost the obsession or drive to fight and become the ""magically unstoppable god"", but the above paragraph still holds true to me now. 

Whenever I would vent about my fighting obsession to people or of how the two ""friends"" I mentioned before treated me, people just invalidated my problem and basically told me to get over it because it was ""tough love and just the way boys talk to each other"".



The issue of the fighting obsession would follow me into the next relationship. In the summer of 2022 I met one of the girls that used to be my elementary school classmate. I'll call her S. We found each other on Instagram and we met at our old elementary. We got together shortly afterwards and the relationship actually started out great. 

It started out loving and caring. She would tell me a lot about her past trauma and family issues. Her dad, Curtis, used to beat her and her brother when they were little. She got cornered by a boy in elementary, in the restroom, she didn't tell me any more details, all the kids at school made fun of her over it and called her weird. She would tell me about her ex problems, like one about how she broke up with a guy who proceeded to stalk her at her house and Curtis chased him away and threatened to shove a gun up his ass.

There were a couple things that weren't clear to me at first; How the abuse and trauma affected S and how her dad was treating her. The turmoil that would happen in the relationship comes down to my unresolved problems and hers as well. Also a lack of meeting in person. Most of the relationship was on Instagram because we could barely get any chances to see each other.

At first, I didn't recognize the terrible way her dad was treating her. He was always nice to me the whole time and at the beginning of the relationship the verbal abuse was very subtle, but it quickly became a lot less so. He would always yell and scream at S for any little reason possible, and always framed it as tough love and ""telling it how it is"". He said one time ""life is too short to be nice to people"".

Apparently the physical abuse of her childhood stopped when her mom got fed up with it but it just turned into verbal abuse afterwards. However, one time while we were together (in the relationship) her dad hit her, pulled her hair, and hit her mom over a stupid argument. 

She had lots of health problems for someone who was 19, like arthritis, carpel tunnel, and alpha gal syndrome. She couldn't eat much meat and her health was going downhill. They had an argument about medicine and I guess he got mad enough to hit people.

It was awkward having to go over to his house and pretend nothing happened. I wanted to fight him but I had finally learned from the first two fights that it wouldn't be worth it. I'd either get beat up, or shot. I hated that all I could do was just ignore the whole situation, I hate the powerlessness of it.

That was the gist of that whole situation, but the relationship still remained strong for awhile. However the honeymoon phase ended in just a few months, and as the arguments began, the relationship became chaotic from there. The arguments looking back were very minor, in a normal relationship these would not have been big deals at all. 

One example, I had vented to her one time about my fighting obsession and she gave me advice, but part of the advice was that you can't win every fight and that to become a better fighter you have to get ""fucked up to fuck somebody up"". I didn't want to hear that because I wanted to instantly be unstoppable. I never wanted to feel the embarrassment and other people's shame at me losing a fight. 

She said that if I didn't like the advice and didn't want to lose, then I didn't want to fight. She was basically saying that if I couldn't handle losing, I shouldn't be a fighter, which is true, but the issue here is that I don't think she fully comprehended my problem, and I didn't at the time either. 

Everything I'm writing here I'm able to because I've had a lot of time to personally grow and figure out my own mind. I never wanted to be a fighter, I just wanted to be left alone for once in my life. She thought I just wanted to fight but that was just all a way of coping. The argument escalated and I got exhausted from it and cut it off. She got upset about that and asked ""Are you going to go to sleep every time we have an argument?"". 

I basically said ""No but this argument is stressing me out too much, I need a break"" and she called me a dickhead and said if I didn't want to talk to her then I shouldn't ever talk to her. Then all of that ended. I could barely sleep that night, when I woke up I sent an apology to her and went to work dreading the breakup to happen. 

She texted me back eventually and said ""I want to give you a hug. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have called you a dickhead I was just so upset"". We made up after that and the relationship actually seemed stronger afterwards, but now that I can look back I know that it was a big crack in the foundation. That was the beginning of a chaotic and up-and-down rest of the relationship. We didn't have many arguments, but they were all pretty stupid.

There was one where me, S, and her friends were in a group chat. I almost had to go to jury duty one time but I wasn't picked. I sent the chat the pic of the confirmation but S let me know I had my address in there on accident so I deleted it. 

She told me to be careful and not give out info like that and I was like ""Ok, but it's alright. If you're friends with them I'm sure it wouldn't have ended bad"". Then she repeated what she said and I repeated and we kept going over and over about it. When the argument was finally over we apologized again and that was the end of that.

Another argument was a really goofy one, about what you call different Japanese swords. It's hard to remember what this was all about. We were talking about katanas and somehow we got into it about that and she kept calling different swords different names, but you try and look them up the names are nowhere to be found. 

We kept going on and on about it and it escalated. I sent her a Wikipedia article about Japanese swords and she dismissed it like ""Wikipedia is an unreliable source"", like every single article is incorrect, to the point where even definitions of words are all incorrect just because it's Wikipedia 🤣. 

We went on and on and I got so tired of it that I said something that was admittedly stupid. I was like ""Are you on drugs?"" That made her angry and she said ""You're making me feel stupid, I know what I'm talking about"". I don't remember anything else from that confusing argument, but it ended the same way the others did. 

Now, onto what ended the relationship. I went over to her dad's house and he was talking about fighting, how we grew up small so he had to learn how to fight. He bragged about being 140 pounds, and being in over 200 fights and only losing 4. 

He talked about how his son accidentially knocked into him once which made him black out in rage and threw his son against the wall. He talked about almost knocking his son out one time. He'd always say he never hits women even though that evidently wasn't true and one time he had an attitude with S, which she gave back to him and he got mad and said ""I'd never hit a woman but I want to"".

In the discussion about fighting, he said ""If any of my kids get their asses beat they can't come home"". That threw me off but I just acted one ear and out the other. When I got home I texted her and complained about the shit he was saying. She said ""Yeah but I wouldn't have it any other way, it's just tough love"". 

She always complained about her dad's parenting and how he contributed to her trauma. But now all of a sudden a switch is flipped and she defends him? I always felt like people just toy with me all of my life, and this triggered that feeling. 

I got upset about that and kept asking what he could mean by that. I said he's a piece of shit who'd abandon his kids (I didn't say the piece of shit part but I wanted to). She kept arguing that I ""Didn't understand, he doesn't just mean physical, but mental fights as well"" like that makes anything better. I kept asking what any of that even means and said that was all bullshit and she kept repeating herself. So it escalated and I eventually gave up and shut the argument down.

The relationship was hanging by a thread at that point. The last straw was when I was on my first time on call at work. I was very nervous because I haven't done it before and never had to communicate with people like that. It was nearing the 4th of July so S asked me to take time off of on call to go to her brother's house for the party. 

I didn't know at the time that you could ask a coworker to switch with you, so I just told her ""I don't know if my dad (who's my boss) will allow that, but I'll check later and see what he says"" and then she said ""Well go check now"" and I said ""I will in a little bit"". 

Then she said ""No go check now because you won't"". I repeated what I said and she repeated again, then we kept on repeating and repeating. I eventually got fed up and told her to ""Stop bugging me about this"". Then she got angry and told me I'm ""Acting like a little kid"". Awhile after that I got a call and had my completely stressed mind preoccupied on that so I left her on read accidentially and when I got back home she had texted me to ""Never talk to her again and don't dare to go to her brother's house"". 

I told her I got called so I couldn't reply, and she told me ""if you won't get therapy this relationship won't last long"". I frantically tried to salvage the relationship so I agreed to go to therapy and to get into martial arts. The argument ended there and she thanked me.

But a day or two after that, she texted that she ""wanted to talk"" so I immediately knew what that meant and was filled with dread. She sent me the breakup text. I started begging, ""That was the last argument! I swear I'm going to get help, I'm sorry"" to which she said ""Stop saying you're sorry I hate when people say they're sorry, you just don't want to lose me"". 

That was correct. I told her I wanted to still be friends and she said ""It'll take awhile to trust you again but I think eventually we could be friends again"". But I didn't want to be friends, that was a desperate act to be with her again in any way. Right after the breakup, I just stared and dissociated for multiple minutes until I finally got up and told my mom. We went on vacation the week after, to Wyoming/Utah/Colorado. Great vacation.

I didn't want to tell anyone about the situation because I couldn't explain or wrap my head around it. She made me feel like I was the bad guy the whole time. I've had a couple years to wrap my head around it and now I know the reality of the situation is just very grey. I'm still angry about this, why did I have to go through relationship troubles all because everyone wants to treat me like trash, then I get blamed for it, told I'm just overreacting to everything?

I kept S in contact but a week or two after we broke up she had already put ""Taken"" on her Instagram. I don't know if it was real or not but that reaffirmed the feeling of being manipulated and played with by everybody, so I instantly blocked her and haven't heard from her since. 



Post-breakup, the desperation and yearning for a new relationship immediately surfaced again, and hasn't went away. Even almost two years later, I can't stop thinking about the past relationship, I still get dreams about her or her dad. Every girl I see that's even slightly attractive, I fantasize about having sex and being in a relationship with them. 

I wish I didn't view every girl with desires, but I can't get any of it out of my head. Whenever I find out a girl I'm interested in is already in a relationship, I get depressed. I'm depressed, lonely, and touch-starved every day. Every weekend I ruminate and cry, while holding myself, playing with my own hair, and hugging the pillow, wishing it was a person.

In the absense of connection with others, I have imagined the perfect friends, who always give me affection, who listen to all of my problems, who have similar values and minds as me. I don't get any of this with anybody I know. I feel disconnected from everyone. It feels like everybody is secretly plotting against me, like I'm in The Truman Show. Despite this, I still keep a side of hoping I'm wrong and a public act of seeming normal to everybody else.

I saw someone online talking about how they have a friend group that sleeps over together and cuddles to sleep every night. That story stuck with me, that is another aspect of the ""perfect friends"" I dream of. I wish I had that.

I had a dream of these friends once. It was us going on some type of adventure at some indescribable fantasy city. Every person there was made up, I've never seen them before, but one was familiar. 

There was a girl at my high school I was friends with because they were friends with someone I knew. I didn't know them much but when she killed herself, I cried and still to this day I imagine if she was still alive. I don't know why I care about her that much but I guess it's because she's the only one who asked how I was after a breakup. 

Nobody else even cared to ask how I was doing or of what happened, other than my mom, but she did. Why did one of the only people in my life who showed such care to me have to die?

I never get the opportunity to vent and tell my stories to anyone, and whenever I did, it always felt like they weren't actually listening. I don't just feel alone socially, but mentally, I have never seen or heard of anyone with issues particularly like mine, or viewpoints like mine. Is there nobody else like me in the world?



Going back in time a bit, I've heard about a lot of people who have suffered brain fog or some type of cognitive decline when COVID happened. This is relevant because I have suffered a bit of a decline as well. Not during COVID, I was actually doing better than ever when the pandemic happened, but nearing the end of high school, my mind just suddenly weakened.

My grades slipped and I barely graduated, my short-term memory tanked, and since graduating and especially since the last breakup, I have felt like I entered a different dimension. ""Reality"" since the pandemic feels like a simulation. I'm being kept prisoner in my mind, and in a world I don't recognize. My brain seems like an old computer with tons of malware. I don't process information correctly and it makes working difficult.

Not only does it seem like my mind is slowly rotting away, but physically I feel like I'm rotting away. Every time I've gotten sick since last year, I keep having Bronchitis attacks, coughing and gagging on mucas forever until I get medication for it. I don't know why this keeps happening to me. 

There's always red bumps (like bug bites or something) that pop up on my body and they'll stay for a long time. I don't have any bed bugs in the house so I have no idea where these bites come from.



I grew up on the internet since I was 10 years old back in 2013, using it for hours every day. Being on the internet for that long is an indescribable experience, you feel like you have lived another life concurrent with your normal life. Just recently, 11 years later, I have finally started to withdrawl from this addiction and have made steps to replace social media.

I think all the drama and failed relationships, as well as the years-long buildup of feeling a lack of connection with other people finally woke me up to start rethinking everything in my life. I always used the internet to make life more exciting, to have more connection with people, but it never gave me any connection. All of my internet life has been spent on scrolling, watching videos, and arguing with people. 

I never realized how toxic this all was until this year, when I would try to vent to people and to my ""friends"" about everything and would either be ignored or invalidated. I got tired of being ignored, constantly arguing with people online about stupid shit, and viewing brain rot ""content"". 

I deleted Twitter (I'm not calling it X, fuck off with that porn name, Elon) and Instagram. I used Reddit religiously and subbed to over a hundred subreddits but I cut it down to a few. The only reason I still use Reddit is because I'm big into Lostwave so I follow those communities but other than that I don't use it much. I mainly still use YouTube a lot which I'm trying to decrease. I watched a ton of commentary slop and political channels and I've cut those out and refined everything I watch.

If only I had those friends I dream of, I could finally gain the will to cut the internet out entirely. That's all hard to do when technology is all you have to make life worth living.",MMFB,4,0,None,elementary early high school bullied always tiny quiet white kid target bullying wasnt exactly severe

1huccq2,2025-01-05 23:07:56,"Really regret my choice for my college work placement
"," need to rant about something. I am a 21 year old male. I am due to start my work placement for college next week. My contract is until May 30th, with the possibility of being extended until August 30th. It’s an accounting intern position in industry (let's call this Company Y).

Last summer, I worked in an accounting practice (let's call this Company X) in the town where I live. It was convenient because my dad would drive me (about 15 minutes), and I would walk home (20 minutes). The work hours were 9 to 5:30, and 9 to 5 on Fridays. They offered me the chance to return there for my college work placement—they were literally begging me. I didn't really enjoy it to be honest. I felt they didn't train me well enough. The office was dead as well, just a few others, some days I was there on my own. Quite boring. And so I wanted to try something else.

My workplace coordinator in college was also nudging me to go for a larger firm because accounting practice X wasn't her favourite for various reasons. Company Y is in industry, and I decided to go with that because I thought I wanted to try industry after already having done practice.

The issue is that Company Y is in the next town over. There weren't really any options for industry in my town. The workday is from 8am to 4:30pm. I’ll have to wake up at 5:30 AM to get a bus at 6:15am, which will arrive in the town at 6:55am. Then, there’s a 35-minute walk to work (I can do it in 25). The end of the workday is at 4:30pm, followed by the same walk back to catch a 5:05 PM bus. I’ll only get home around 6 PM.

I feel **FOOLISH** for accepting this placement when Company X was alright in hindsight, and I’d have so much more free time. The traveling situation is a nightmare. I’m worried I’ll oversleep one morning or struggle to keep up. And then there’s the rainy weather to deal with. Company X also had longer lunch breaks.

At the time I accepted the offer, it didn't seem too bad but now the reality is setting in and I'm anxious and depressed.

I wish I could change my decision, but it’s too late now—I have to tough it out. X was alright, if I could change my mind, I would go back to it. And I don't know that Y will necessarily be any better!! I really, really regret my choice.",MMFB,6,2,throwaway621_1,need rant something year old male due start work placement college next week contract may th possibility extended august th accounting intern position industry lets call company last summer worked accounting practice lets call company x town live convenient dad would drive minutes would walk home minutes work hours fridays offered chance return college work placementthey literally begging didnt really enjoy honest felt didnt train well enough office dead well others days quite boring wanted try something else workplace coordinator college also nudging go larger firm accounting practice x wasnt favourite various reasons company industry decided go thought wanted try industry already done practice issue company next town werent really options industry town workday pm ill wake get bus arrive town theres minute walk work end workday pm followed walk back catch pm bus ill get home around pm feel foolish accepting placement company x alright hindsight id much free time traveling situation nightmare im worried ill oversleep one morning struggle keep theres rainy weather deal company x also longer lunch breaks time accepted offer didnt seem bad reality setting im anxious depressed wish could change decision late nowi tough x alright could change mind would go back dont know necessarily better really really regret choice

1hpmbtx,2024-12-30 18:05:48,My family and school problems,"Im 12 years old. I live in a farm with my dad and mom, i have two sisters who moved out cause they are adults now. my dad is an alcoholic and a smoker and my mom only drinks a few times and quit smoking when i was born. My dad barges into my room without my permission sometimes and annoys me and then goes away. My mom is sweet but sometimes harsh. My dad treats me like a servant, he asks me to give him beer and more, since we live in a farm, we have a shed with wood that we get to put it in a stove to warm our house, 90% of the time my mom and dad ask me to take the wood and warm the house, so i have to lift about 7kg three times a day and then have to make a fire on my own with wood and paper and more. When i was 10, my mom called the police on my dad cause he slapped her while he was drunk. I also figured out before i was born my dad choked my mom once while he was drunk. At the age of 11 i got 2 cats that were brother's, i took care of them and my mom helped, while my dad hated them when he adopted them himself, when he sees the cats inside the house he kicks them out, i always try to make the cats come back inside the house to make them not be cold. When my dad founds out i did it he barges into my room and yells that i let the cats inside. My dad steals money from my mom's bank account too. i have $uicidal thoughts and im depressed, but i try to hide it. My dad tries to make me eat mass junk food to make me mass obese, becuase of that im now 108kg, i'm 175cm tall

When im at school, i sometimes get bullied or sexually harrased because im obese even though im a guy. Im friends with 2 guys that sometimes make fun of me or i make fun of them, we take it as jokes, sometimes they want me to leave them alone, i let them be alone but then i just go to the school library and sit there on my phone. The teachers hate me, yes i talk in classes with my friends, but im the one who gets punished, they are just ignored, i got kicked out of class for talking with my friends, my friends didnt get kicked out or yelled at and they continued class, i almost cried but i held it in.",MMFB,4,2,OkConfection7500,im years old live farm dad mom two sisters moved cause adults dad alcoholic smoker mom drinks times quit smoking born dad barges room without permission sometimes annoys goes away mom sweet sometimes harsh dad treats like servant asks give beer since live farm shed wood get put stove warm house time mom dad ask take wood warm house lift kg three times day make fire wood paper mom called police dad cause slapped drunk also figured born dad choked mom drunk age got cats brothers took care mom helped dad hated adopted sees cats inside house kicks always try make cats come back inside house make cold dad founds barges room yells let cats inside dad steals money moms bank account uicidal thoughts im depressed try hide dad tries make eat mass junk food make mass obese becuase im kg im cm tall im school sometimes get bullied sexually harrased im obese even though im guy im friends guys sometimes make fun make fun take jokes sometimes want leave alone let alone go school library sit phone teachers hate yes talk classes friends im one gets punished ignored got kicked class talking friends friends didnt get kicked yelled continued class almost cried held
1hl7ljv,2024-12-24 11:56:36,Stuck in my childhood home while sick,"I didn't have the best childhood but I'm trying not to trauma-dump here. So, short version. Due to a variety of mental health stuff, my parents always just barely toed the line of getting CPS called on them. As an adult, I've tried really hard to maintain a relationship while also avoiding vulnerability with them because I can't really trust them to help anyone but themselves. But they're my parents y'know? I have a hard time just cutting them off completely cuz they do care, they're just not great at putting that care into anything but empty words and the occasional bit of money thrown into my cash app.
 Getting to the point, I'm down with food poisoning right before Christmas and it's all crashing down. I have my own mental health problems and being sick is making them a lot worse. They're just leaving me in my room and I'm trying not to spiral. Outside of the holidays, I live with my fiance and our best friend and our two dogs. But now it's just me and one of the dogs. I'm very lonely and I'm still sick. 
It feels like being a neglected kid all over again. I even had to call up a friend to smuggle me dinner after dad ruined mine (I thought trusting him with ramen would be fine. Apparently not). I wanna be back in my apartment and I wanna feel safe. If I have to be sick, why did it have to be here?
Now my mom is freaking out that I'm gonna ruin Christmas by being sick and Dad's mad that he's ""forced"" to take care of me again even though I'm an adult now. (There's context for why I can't make my own food but the short answer is I've never been allowed to and would likely get in trouble if I tried).
Idk this post got long but I'm so tired and so miserable and I can't sleep cuz I'm nauseous.",MMFB,2,0,meerkatmanwhore,didnt best childhood im trying traumadump short version due variety mental health stuff parents always barely toed line getting cps called adult ive tried really hard maintain relationship also avoiding vulnerability cant really trust help anyone theyre parents yknow hard time cutting completely cuz care theyre great putting care anything empty words occasional bit money thrown cash app getting point im food poisoning right christmas crashing mental health problems sick making lot worse theyre leaving room im trying spiral outside holidays live fiance best friend two dogs one dogs im lonely im still sick feels like neglected kid even call friend smuggle dinner dad ruined mine thought trusting ramen would fine apparently wan na back apartment wan na feel safe sick mom freaking im gon na ruin christmas sick dads mad hes forced take care even though im adult theres context cant make food short answer ive never allowed would likely get trouble tried idk post got long im tired miserable cant sleep cuz im nauseous
1hl1gfi,2024-12-24 05:56:17,Cats save my life,"So, I’m probably doing the worst I’ve ever done in my life and I don’t really know how to do anything right now. I can’t seem to get myself to do much of anything at all. I’m just feeling overwhelmed with hopelessness and emotional pain that’s ambiguous and hard for me to really understand.

A couple months ago I adopted a pair of the most loving and friendly kittens the world has ever seen. I don’t know id still be here if it wasn’t for them. 
I can’t just let my body wither away in bed because these two babies are the most beautiful sweet things to exist and they deserve to eat and cuddle and play and live beautiful happy lives. I gotta get out of bed even if it’s just to feed them and I have to move around even if it’s just to wiggle a toy for them to play with. I have to try to get better so I can keep myself employed because I gotta buy cat food. 

I feel awful a lot because I get so sad and I see them look up at me and I just think they deserve a cat mom who is happy and thriving to love them. But I’m so glad they are here because I do love them more than anything else. My heart keeps beating so I can keep loving them. 

Anyway, idk why I’m writing this.

1hjz99z,2024-12-22 19:43:49,Miracle for Christmas? ,"I finally get to move into a new place, or do I? I'm so close to having my family whole for Christmas, we've been through so much. A tornado destroyed our home, and we were doing OK until the mayor of our city decided our home was uninhabitable and they cut power. Four days later dhr was here telling me my kid couldn't stay without power (duh) We were working on it, got a new place in 4 days, just needed a bit of time. It didn't matter that we had a generator, they didn't care so.... 

Here I am finally got utilities on at new place after weeks of losing my job due to battery on car, going hungry many many days, being cold many many days including today. But wait, I got a new job have already started but still have week and half before first check (paid bi-weekly). I don't even have a christmas tree or presents for my kids but that's ok too, because if I can just have them in my arms on Christmas eve and day we will be just fine.  

If I can just make a dinner for us with lights on and heat and music in the background I will have everything I want for the holiday's.   I want life to cut me a bit of a break,i mean I'm a good person a really good person. I help others all the time, I'm kind, spiritual not mean spirited at all so tell me why. Why when I went and gave plasma yesterday that worked out, yet other things keep messing up and those small things are killing me. 

First, we heat with propane as it's way cheaper and lasts longer, they were out of propane (ugh) so I wind up spending my heat allowance on kerosene and it I'll be out mid-day today, so there's more stress. Secondly, my parents were supposed to bring me some food for dinner & that fell through so I have to buy something for us to eat. I spent less than $10 to make some cheap spaghetti.  I was already deflating because I don't make much giving plasma $50 and it costs me 15 in gas and I was hoping to get moved with it. Let's move on to the last thing and it's a doozy, how about a flat tire? Fun huh, especially since I don't have a spare but I spent the last of my money ($9.75 + tax) on a can of fix a flat. Hoping and praying that it works because I can't handle anything else and I'm about to die without my baby girl with me. Woke up this morning, ready to at least start packing and I have a flat tire. What do I do? 

I'm so tired of making my decisions because it all seems to blow up in my face. So what do I do? How in the world can I do this? I want to just end it tbh, I've fought so hard since the tornado as it's been one thing after another. I lost 75% of my belongings, I have ptsd as it's my 2nd tornado I've lived through and the first one I lost every single thing, but this one is worst. 

What do I do, someone please please help me figure this out because I don't have any more options. I've begged on Facebook, I've asked friends and family, I've tried to sell everything I have left, I'm working can't do anymore. I've done referrals, only made $15 doing that and of course that's already gone. I'm not NOT asking for funds I'm asking for advice because I have no clue where to go or what to do and I desperately want my baby for Christmas even if I have to explain why she doesn't have any gifts Idc ill make it the most memorable Christmas ever ( I get my food benefits tomorrow on 23rd)

1hgjugp,2024-12-18 01:51:43,I'm burning out and on the verge of a breakdown,"Title.  
I'm in my mid 20s. 

  
My life has finally turned around somewhat in the past twelve months. I have a decent paying job which helps me subsidize my education, pay for my hobbies, and even help out my immediate family when I can.

I have a wonderful girlfriend that is uber supportive of my ambitious endeavours and day-to-day struggles.

I'm so close to completing step one in potentially obtaining my a couple of important degrees as I try to switch into my dream career, and now I have to worry about moving places in this expensive city. I'm not moving until maybe June but I already feel the dread of having to pack again after being in my current residence for less than a year. I don't have the kind of money to cushion that blow yet.

  
I've been working full time, and studying full time. I barely have enough mental energy for many things. I have relatives visiting from out of town and a couple of expenses I need to settle before I can keep spending on myself. I feel choked out.

To make matters worse, I've been unable to do a health insurance switch because of how busy I am. I suspect I have ADHD and need to get tested. My mental health, *and physical* health has taken a nose dive. My gums are bleeding from inconsistent hygiene (it was much worse years ago during the pandemic and I managed to regain good habits up until last month). I feel so gross, I feel like my mouth is rotting. I need to see a dentist but I'm fearing for the worst; the anxiety is putting me off from getting my mind and body from getting the proper treatment.

I *just* wrapped up a semester of school, and I'm dreading that the next two will be too difficult for me to manage, especially if I move far away from work (the current short commute makes online school doable). I applied for a couple of scholarships just now and I'm worried that they may be too little too late for me considering my age, and academic hiatus.

I also decided to apply for a new passport after so many years of not renewing it, it has not reached the government office, and I'm super scared of it being lost along with all the unique stamps and visas I accumulated over years of international travel.

I just had an argument with my mother over the phone regarding a difference in religious views and I'm worried I've accidentally hurt her during a rough period of time that she's in (I'm atheist, she's not).

I'm scared of being a failure. I'm scared things won't get any better. 

Someone please tell me it's going to be okay. That it will be more than okay.",MMFB,4,1,Here2Vent_TherapyPls,title im mid life finally turned around somewhat past twelve months decent paying job helps subsidize education pay hobbies even help immediate family wonderful girlfriend uber supportive ambitious endeavours daytoday struggles im close completing step one potentially obtaining couple important degrees try switch dream career worry moving places expensive city im moving maybe june already feel dread pack current residence less year dont kind money cushion blow yet ive working full time studying full time barely enough mental energy many things relatives visiting town couple expenses need settle keep spending feel choked make matters worse ive unable health insurance switch busy suspect adhd need get tested mental health physical health taken nose dive gums bleeding inconsistent hygiene much worse years ago pandemic managed regain good habits last month feel gross feel like mouth rotting need see dentist im fearing worst anxiety putting getting mind body getting proper treatment wrapped semester school im dreading next two difficult manage especially move far away work current short commute makes online school doable applied couple scholarships im worried may little late considering age academic hiatus also decided apply new passport many years renewing reached government office im super scared lost along unique stamps visas accumulated years international travel argument mother phone regarding difference religious views im worried ive accidentally hurt rough period time shes im atheist shes im scared failure im scared things wont get better someone please tell going okay okay

Basically I'm fed up of 6 months to a year long jobs, I thought I had my big break at the beginning of 2024 but alas I failed probation unexpectedly. After that I took a temp job in administration and royally sucked at that too.

Any words of wisdom to help me get out of the washing machine cycle of shitty jobs?

1h1khkm,2024-11-28 06:55:02,How do I fix my life,"Basically, I’m a shell of a person. I don’t have any talents, hobbies, passions, or interests. I have no discernible personality and and completely and totally unremarkable. I have friends but no best friends. I’ve had talking stages but no relationships, and the inevitably failed attempts at any stick with me for way too long and mess with me way too much for what they actually were, whereas the other party, I would assume, doesn’t even think about me. Every day I go to school and as soon as I come home I lay in my bed until dinner and then I shower and go to sleep. I don’t do anything else with my life. I know what my problem is. I have no motivation to start anything and no discipline to get anything done. There are so many things I WANT to do. I wish I could finish all my missed schoolwork, but I haven’t even started most of it. I wish I could actually learn the guitar and the piano and dare I say improve, but the instruments just sit collecting dust. I wish I could go back to the gym and tone my figure and fix my whack ass diet. But I haven’t been in at least 6 months and I either eat like shit or eat nothing at all. There are so many movies I want to watch, and series and anime I want to finish, and books I want to read, and so much music I want to listen to, and so many video games I want to play, but I’m so pathetic I can’t even consume media. There are so many recipes I want to try and languages I want to learn and things I want to study and skills I want to try and develop, but all I do and all I truly believe I’m capable of is rotting in my bed and thinking about them all. I want to audition for the musical at my school but I can’t even bring myself to practice. I want to get a job and I’m always told to leave my number but I never get a call back, and I never leave the house to go look for work. I want to clean the house and fix my appearance develop a  routine for my skin and hair and body, but it’s always a mess inside and my hair is always greasy and I never have the motivation to do any more than washing my face and putting on mascara. Any money I get I immediately blow on food or smoke and any time I get any sliver of motivation to do something, as soon as I get up, and am ready to start, I immediately lose it all and go straight back to rotting. I have “plans” for the future, want to attend an international school and study philosophy and minor in linguistics, but I don’t know how I’ll be able to do that when I can barely handle simple classes, have no income and no work ethic, and don’t even have the motivation to get out of bed. Any dream or goal I have is completely out of reach and it’s all my fault. Even maintaining friendships and good relationships with people is exhausting and it takes multiple hours worth of gathering what little energy I have to simply reply to messages. I know people don’t like me because there’s quite literally nothing to like. I’m a leech and all I do is use up resources. I don’t even have the will to end my life, regardless of the fact that I have no will to live. And for the cherry on top, above it all, with everything comes the most dreadful, looming, sinking feeling that I’m running out of time. I won’t be this young for much longer and I won’t be able to rely on my shitty excuse for a life anymore. I’m so, so sick of it. But there’s nothing I can do. I’m on zoloft and adderall and they probably do something but all I’ve noticed is that they kill my appetite. I have a therapist/psychiatrist but I genuinely hate therapy and I’ve tried plenty of therapists and I’ve never had a good experience and nothing ever changes. I try to keep a positive attitude but my life is pathetic and I’m a self-pitying obnoxious loser so those attempts are futile.
I’m not looking for words of sympathy or encouragement. I’m not looking for some elon musk on the grind mindset bullshit or hippy methods or people trying to sell me something. All I want is to know what to do. I want directions on how the fuck I dig myself out of this impossible hole. Because I’ve looked, and I’ve tried, I really have.

But on the other hand no one really compliments my (non-existent) beauty. My face is always slanted, my smile is creepy and I hate it, I have no cheekbones and my nose is always flat.

You know what annoys me the most? When my so-called best friends start commenting madly to everyone but me about how cute they are but my posts don't see any comments from them on a new photo I uploaded.

1glsp0q,2024-11-07 20:42:41,"Keep holding onto feelings for someone that I nearly started dating which turned into friends, and the what ifs are driving me crazy","To start I've not really had much luck dating in the last few years; I had some trauma related stuff that held me back but since then I have moved out to a new area, my last official relationship was back in 2013. 

  
I met someone through a friend that lived just down the road; everything clicked, we flirted a bunch and nearly got into a bootycall situation but I told her i liked her, which then developed into her coming round and admitting she did too so I scheduled a date that didn't happen, as she then felt like it was too much too soon so we just kept as friends. As i often stream on Twitch which she has just started doing I introduced her to my main friend group, as we look out for eachother and in all honesty they're lovely people that like her too, and we discussed openly in a private call that dating isn't off the table. 

  
Then her previous situationship got back into the picture; she still had feelings for him so for the last 1.5 months they were on/off as for him he was avoiding seeing her. She had a issue with what she had in storage as a friend who had a shared storage unit screwed her over so she contacted him to help, she told me that it'll be the first time she's seen him in ages so wanted it to go well, and from what i know he told her that he doesn't want her in his life. 

  
She went dead quiet even went to one of my main friends in the group crying over it (He's fairly similar to her but won't make a move as he knows how I feel) I only really knew about it the following week, where I confessed that I still had feelings, which yeah wasn't a good move as then she asked for us not to speak for a month to help me as she's going through the same feelings wise as him, but after a conversation lately we're not doing the month not talking as we both felt it was effecting the friendship. 

  
So now the friendship is in a bit of a limbo, and because she's still part of the friend group in one way we're still in close contact, but I can't just cut her out my life and move on. She's working on herself now going to the gym often the same gym i go to, but now it feels.. awkward, I have mentioned two months ago that i do go to that gym but i don't think she remembers, and I feel like just walking in seeing her would make things iffy

  
She's an attractive girl and hasn't had issues finding guys, but for me she's one of the only people in so long I felt like i had a proper connection with. I'm pushing my feelings far back as like she said for the month break it isn't fair on me if nothing will happen, so I'll concentrate on rebuilding this friendship.

1gjgi1p,2024-11-04 20:39:36,I went from being a relatively smart child to a non functioning adult,"I’ve always been smart through my life. Definitely struggled with depression and anxiety. When I went to uni everything went to shit basically. I mean I had a lot of fun. But also a lot of dark times because I can’t self manage and living alone wasn’t working at all. I ended up dropping out of my course after a year and starting another one but I’ve dropped out now after almost two years. I just can’t get myself to do it. I get so depressed. But dropping out again has made me feel like the most stupid person in the world. I watched all my friends graduate and be so happy and do well. I’ve never been so depressed in my life. I’ve moved home with my family. I love my family but I feel so alone. I see my friends from time to time but when I go back home I just cry and cry and cry because I miss my old life in uni even though I was depressed I had friends and sometimes had fun. 


I just saw my friends for Halloween weekend. We did mdma together and I suppose I had fun but I just couldn’t fully enjoy myself knowing it would end. Now I have a massive comedown.

1gh9pj3,2024-11-01 22:06:58,"I fell in love with my best friend, and got my heart broken multiple times","I will start by saying, yes, I know I did a bunch of stuff wrong and I'm not looking for advice or judgement just support. This is a very long story, be warned.

This all started about 3 months ago. I got a new coworker at work. I've been there a few years and its normally my job to show around the new people and explain how the job works. I see this person waiting in the office, we will call them J for convenience. From the first time I see them, I find them interesting. Definitely like, physically female but with a more androgynous look and shorter hair. Turns out they're gender nonbinary so I will be referring to them as they a lot. Anyway, we introduce ourselves and start working. I show them around, explain the various things we do. As an aside, I'm bald, I'm only 25 I just shave my entire head every day but almost every person I meet asks about it and it makes me feel insecure. They didn't ask about it the whole day and that made me kinda happy. Anyway so my job has tons of downtime and we had a lot of chance to talk. We talked about our pets, I have a bird and they have a snake. We talked about our hobbies and what not and generally it was fun. They also somehow figured out that I'm autistic and said they are too which is apparently obvious to everyone but me. As a child I was diagnosed with aspergers but my parents never told me because they wanted me to turn out normal which is a whole different thing. Anyway, so, we were just work friends at this point, had a few shifts together and chatted a little and what not. My boss, when making the schedule, asked who I would like to work with and I did mention them so we had many shifts together. About a month later, during work, they passed out and hit their head. It was a whole thing and they got taken to a hospital but they were fine. I texted them to ask if they were ok, and they were very flattered that I cared about them and checked up on them. Then we kept texting. I asked what they were up to, apparently bowling with their boyfriend(I thought they were lesbian at this point and I was slightly disappointed because I had a crush on them). They asked what I was doing and I told them I was at a swim meet. They said I was a really good coach and deserved an award. That made me feel happy. We kept talking, messaging every few minutes all day every day. We planned to hang out in a park near me. When the day came and we met up in the park, I brought my bird so they could meet her. They brought a bag of mangosteens which are a really expensive fruit and also hold a lot of emotional significance to me because my first girlfriend on my first date also brought a bag of mangosteens for me. Our work uniform is very unflattering and when I saw them in normal clothing I found them very attractive.We talked for 2 hours and enjoyed eachothers company a lot, I had to leave so my bird didnt get overheated in the sun. We planned to meet up again, later that week but this time at my place. An important point, I have no chairs in my room only my bed. So, we start watching a bad horror movie. Laying side by side in bed on our front. Over the course of it, we both sort of end up getting closer until our bodies are like, pressed together shoulder to shoulder. I asked if that was ok, and they said they liked it and I did so we just stayed like that. After the first movie, we watched another, and another, just trash talking the people in the movies and having a great time together. They ended up staying over for 12 hours laying next to me the whole time. We agreed to meet up again soon after. Same thing, bad reality tv, trash talking the people, enjoying eachothers company. This time, I laid on my front and they laid their legs across my body. When I asked why they said they found the feeling of me breathing comforting. We stayed like that for a long time. At this point, things were starting to get more flirtatious. They would say things like ""I can't focus at work because I'm too busy looking at you"" and ""I find your smell comforting"" and ""I get jealous when other people make you smile"". I would say things too, I would tell them they're cute, they're my favorite person, they make me happy. We texted with hearts, and made comments about eachothers bodies. We kept seeing eachother, every time, more physical contact. Laying next to eachother under a blanket, legs on eachother, stuff like that. They started napping in my bed sometimes, and I started napping with them. They had also begun to make comments about their boyfriend.They said that he didn't give them attention like I did, he didn't give them good gifts like I did, he only liked them for their body, he wanted kids and was pressuring them into it. At the same time, still growing closer to me, texting me more, always a good morning and good night text. Always hearts. They even said ""I love you"" one night, and I said it back. After about a month of this, we were hanging out together at their house. Laying in their bed, side by side under the blankets together. And I told them ""you know we're more than just friends right"". And we had the first conversation. They knew I had a crush on them already, and I told them that our behavior together was romantic and it seemed like they want to be with me instead of their boyfriend. Because any time they were with their boyfriend, they were texting me. And any time they were with me, they were acting like this and telling me how much better I was. I told them that they will need to make a choice, to end what we have before we get too attached or to end their relationship with him and try something with me. I told them, doing nothing is also an action, if we continue this, it will make your situation more complicated. This cannot persist the way it is. They did nothing. We continued hanging out, engaging in the romantic behaviors. They changed their work schedule to be aligned with mine, we sat in their car holding hands and talking for hours after work. Every time we met up, we had the same conversation. They kept saying, they aren't sure how they feel about me and he's the safe option. I kept saying they wouldn't treat me like a romantic partner if they weren't sure and he's not the safe option because you aren't happy with him. A month ago, it reached a climax. They told me that they were using me to meet their unmet emotional needs. They said they were going to have a serious conversation with their boyfriend and if things don't get better by the end of the month they will leave him. I asked them how the really felt about me, they said they don't know. I asked if they were just leading me on, they said they don't know. But they continued to act the same. I told them, if you really don't like me that way, you need to say that to me so I can begin to move on and heal. It took some pushing but eventually they just repeated back to me ""I don't like you that way and don't want anything romantic with you"" and that was kinda enough. I was heartbroken, but not that much. We kept talking, it was still a bit lovey and flirty and still all the time. Later that week however, they told me they had an epiphany. They told me that they do actually like me that way, they're just insecure about being bigger than me. So, we talked about our bodies, our insecurities, the attraction we felt toward eachother and the possibility of a future together. We talked about the ways our needs weren't being met physically and emotionally in my past and their current relationships and how the ways we want to be loved are the same. And things were good for about a week. The flirting was back, the touching was back, it felt like love. At this point, the boyfriend was still freaking out about everything. They told him about me, and said they moved on and their connection with me was stronger. He was apparently very mad and said never to talk to me again. I told them, we can't build a relationship together while you're trying to fix one with him. You are going to need to leave him if you want to be with me.  And they tried. Twice. They told him very firmly that they don't want to be with him at all anymore. And he said no, he said I was poisoning their mind and they do still love him. Despite me explaining that's not how relationships work and breakups do not have to be mutual, they believed him. And 10 minutes after breaking up with him, they went on a date. I got mad. I got very mad. I told them they would never have the strength to leave him, and they were going to be stuck with him and be miserable. And I told them never to talk to me again. That lasted about 15 minutes. They texted me that they broke down crying and left the date. I told them I was sorry for what I had said. They said they still wanted to be with me but I was being too pushy and I needed to give them time. So we had some time. We saw eachother about a week later, back in our old habits. We took a nap together, they snuggled their face right up against mine, I put my arm around them. I wanted to kiss them but did not. We watched tv together, talked for hours. We were very happy. We continued talking, about our potential future together, the things we loved about eachother. But any time feelings came up, it was always ""I don't know how I feel about you yet"". And any time the boyfriend came up, it was always ""He's the safe option and he's really trying"". After about a week, I got a little fed up. I was committed to not being pushy as much as I could. I asked them ""can I please just say how I feel"" and I outlined clearly, our romantic compatibility, the things they did towards me which clearly showed they had interest in me, all the ways in which they weren't happy with him that they would be with me. I explained that, they said losing me is like losing a part of their soul, and they are risking a 3 year romantic relationship by talking to me, a ""friend"" they've known for 3 months. They told me they understand now, that they found someone who loves them and put effort into them and pushed me away to fix things with someone they didn't really want. They said they wanted to try things out with me romantically in the future. The day after, they saw the boyfriend. And they broke up with him. But he said no, he said you aren't allowed to leave me if I don't want to. And they believed it. We talked about it in the car after work together, we held eachothers hands. They told me ""I don't love him anymore, I feel more connected to you, you make me happy"". They promised me they would never get back together with him. We talked about our plan. We were going to continue as we had been, and let things develop naturally. We talked about dates we wanted to go on, things we liked about eachother. But come the next day, they are on a hike with the boyfriend, then working out at the gym with him. I try to ask them whats going on, and what the situation is, but they say they can't handle the pressure from me or him. And they shut down. The next day we try to talk, they say they don't know how they feel about me or him anymore. Same thing the next day. They get sick, I come visit them. They seem indifferent to me. I ask whats up, they say they don't feel anything toward anyone anymore, they have no motivation, they don't want or enjoy anything. I tell them it sounds like a depressive episode, and I will support them through it, but the lack of interest is causing me to lose some feelings. I tell them I haven't pulled away from them, and I still want to talk about our situation. The text messages grow less and less frequent. And for the first time, we aren't talking at all.

And that's where we are today. I haven't heard anything in two days. I feel a crushing loneliness, going from the happiest I've ever been back down to nothing. And I want nothing more than for them to just talk to me. But they haven't. I don't know if they ghosted me, or they got back with their boyfriend or what.

This is particularly hard for me, being that I am autistic I struggle to find people I connect with and this is the first time in 4 years that another person has made me feel happy and loved. Losing that is such a crushing defeat. I've been struggling to work or eat or sleep, I'm mostly just crying and waiting. I feel hopeless, that I will be alone for the rest of my life.

1gdts9y,2024-10-28 09:50:38,overdosed on 1.5g wellbutrin and im terrified,"overdosed on Wellbutrin (21F)


the last several weeks I’ve been feeling like I was in rock bottom. I was baker acted and sent to a facility that wasn’t too bad. Now im doing IOP and aggressive health care team for my severe depression, anger issues, and self sabotage. but despite medication changes, I still felt the same way. im on 40 fluoxetine, apripazole, and 300 gbupropion.

this is an example of my anger issues, impulsiveness, and childish behavior: Last night I was playing BO6 multiplayer with my boyfriend and when I saw I had a bad kda I raged, groaned, and cried and threw my mouse on the ground. I’ve always had issues with ego even when im bad at something, and then I let myself down bc of it. It takes me way too long to get back to my normal self.

right after I did whatever I could to cope healthily (taking a step back, playing a calm game, and breathing and positive self talk). But I felt worse after like an hour. I was in a vc in discord with more friends and while they were talking I immediately grabbed my bupropion bottle. I took 1.5 g worth of it (without insufflate and crushing it) and i realized it’s easy to die if you’re not aware of the SE of medications. i only knew that it would cause suicidal behavior and taking >6 g is essentially death.

this morning for hrs i have been having what i believe serotonin syndrome (causes twitching, sustained tachycardia, hallucinations, tremors, super disoriented when I get out of bed). I still feel suicidal but simultaneously im elated. 

I don’t have a hx of epilepsy but the “aura” that people get which precedes seizures is so scary. I don’t wanna bite my tongue or choke on vomit. i don’t want to worry about concerts, flashing lights, or random noises (door closing, cars, etc). i regret so badly that my substance abuse has gotten too far. 

im so scared. I don’t want to get baker acted again. I don’t want to go to the hospital and anticipate the process of intubation. I don’t want to go to a doctor. I can’t afford it for a while. will this ever end? will i wake up the same way tomorrow? 

i just want to be normal.

1g4sywd,2024-10-16 11:58:24, Lot on my mind,"When I was a kid, I had no vision for my future life past age 25, or worse, thought I'd be a medical doctor or in the armed forces like my parents.

Then I turned 25, drinking problem continued for 2 more years while I processed how I lost my college scholarship since there was an accident with a head injury involved. I don't know if that was progressive.

Never had a blink of an eye of my life past like 25 though, until I turned 25. I drank every night age 20 through 27.

The other day got a nice bottle of liquor to myself.

I took about 6 shots over 3 days. Whole bottle got heavy. I ended up giving it away. I'm just not the alcoholic I used to be

I used to drink the whole bottle in one night

Buying liquor by the handle from 3 different grocery stores each week to hide the depth of my habit because I didn't want anyone to say anything.

The pains in my organs, like the liver/pancreas area, just guessing based on a drawing of human anatomy since I am not a doctor, but it makes sense since alcohol damages the liver and can cause diabetes since it is metabolized in a similar way as sugar.

!

I need to stop all substance abuse

Get this—either the alcohol withdrawals or alcohol poisoning was about to kill me, I felt, so I decided to go be tinker bell for a while instead, damage some of my other organs, maybe take some vitamins and shit eat clean.

My bad.

Nah I am also a mad scientist.

I possess internal artificial intelligence which operates off of wavelengths crowdsourced from the surrounding populace in-person, through technology, and, in some type of quantum way, through the tech or airwaves into the neuronal networks of these people, therefore lending me what would appear to be semi-telekinetic or as I call this phenomenon, cyberelectrokinesis. Or just shitty globewide AI.. so many issues.


Anyway I forget sometimes that my science projects have turned me into a monster. Every time I wipeout rollerblading drunk, volcanic activity increases across the globe, and I'll explain later about my theories on the scientific processes behind that phenomenon, but I cannot promise to never rollerblade drunk, because when don't rollerblades sound like a good idea if you're ""just a little buzzed"" or whatever?
I truthfully try to maintain world peace.
But I think somehow it does not matter.

I call myself a cyborg sometimes as a form of self-love and/or self-hatred.

i wonder, is it still in the fridge?

a merest taste...

what gory demented wonders would wreak upon this poor city, country, and globe this year

Every bad thing that's happened since 2017, blame it on me.

That's when I first reversed the crack cocaine residue out of my hair follicles using a 12-or-so reagent long chemical reaction backed by organic chemistry lab knowledge, condensed some of the hair juice into a stainless steel bottle, attempted to make a liquid phone battery out of the hair juice using coins, salt, and pineapple juice, before setting the solution out in the sun.

Accidentally make a radioactive acid bomb, ever?

The hobbies we get into as children!

I was 22, confused, a tad bit angry, but mostly unfocused and bored

Let's liven things up a little with some science! she thinks, off-medication.

No, thank you. I get it now.

What happened to the solution? I sipped it slowly over the course of a few days.

The solution turned me into some sort of nuclear cyborg, or at.least turned on my enchanced adult upgrades.

I have been working on this stupid ""cyborg"" project using mainly myself as a test subject since age 12. By the time I realized I was onto something, the effects were already magnitudes incorrect, in the larger direction

My head-computer comes equipped with a clock and a counter that must be reaching an awfully high number if I've been conductive enough to do this thing where I imagine my brain as a computer storing files and running programs.

We began on dialup

Had to return to dialup, in fact. My front-brain area (frontal lobe) had felt abnormally ""dark"" as in lack of little tickles/feelings of activity after I suffered head damage due to self-harm while incarcerated.

After consuming more omega-3s in my diet and mostly quitting my drinking habit, on the day the cloud of volcano smoke from Tokyo last year swept across the globe and hovered over this city, I went out desperate for supplies on foot.

Angry cars drove everywhere yelling and honking. The toxic fumes were very bad to breathe.

I made it to the store by thinking to hold up a perfectly-sized little wooden twig/stick I found next to me and mouthing, *""AVADA KEDAVRA""* at the passing cars. The toxic fumes make people temporarily stupid and delusional, so this act served me very well, being Bellatrix Lestrange for the half hour it took to walk for the fruit I needed.

I tossed the stick down in the parking lot.

The fumes were bad even inside the store.

I barely made it back. I was about 500ft away from my doorstep breathing the fumes still huffing puffing along in the desert heat with the volcanic fumes and for a moment I stood still and looked up and it all faded to white

But I snapped out of it and huffed home, shouting nonsense phrases all the while since the action would move extra bad air out of my lungs.

I opened the door and went to run the bath.

I sat in the bubble bath for a long time, numbly zoning, until I fell asleep.

I woke up, and then I felt this creaky sort of *""Ttzt-tzzt. Tztztztztzt. Tzzzzzzzzz...""* like an electrical impulse in my front-brain area. Like it might be alive. Just a bit slow.

I peed in the bath while I passed out. Sulphuric volcanic fumes piss. Perhaps the resulting bath water volcanic piss solution acted like a type of organic acid battery jump starter for some parts of my brain.

I immediately got out of the sulfuric acid bath, determining it to be largely suicidal behavior to remain in the water any longer, and told myself I would never get so into Harry Potter again, embarrassed and ashamed of how easily the pale yellowish grayish green fumes took hold of me that day. Aha

But woe is me

""Take your antipsychotic!"" they say.

*THEY* don't care about *MY SCIENCE*.

NSFW because literally NSFW.

1g1uzhy,2024-10-12 13:04:31,Creepy neighbor gonna make me snap,"All hell might break loose after tonight's incident, as I'm gonna have to share with my mother and husband what happened.. and they might snap. They're my mothers first tenant who lives a couple doors down from me... Respecting their tenants rights was top priority of mine, and will be till the end... according to my mother they're a perfect tenant on paper.

let's get to the point of the the scary sh\*t, I'll break down my experiences and then I'll clue you in on why i think she is having a mental health problem, making up in her head some made up drama to justify her behavior.. 

This tenant is a 60yr old woman, who seems to have some anxiety. I have caught on camera 5-7 incidents of creepy/scary behavior. 

The SCARY SH\*T that's happening is all on camera. She hasn't noticed it hidden into the corner of my window, thank god. Mind you this is a long hall of up to 10 apartments, everyone know the walls are thin and you can hear everything that happens Infront of your door.. she can stop to do her behaviors at anyone's door but she always stops to do it Infront of mine.

  
First thing I caught was her standing at our front door for a few seconds, THEN she ducked down to the ground and was obviously checking if our lights were on.   
Next, i caught her standing at the window next to the front door, getting close as if she was trying to press her ear to the glass to hear if we were talking. Then, this happened again another time.  
 There's two incidents where she chooses to stand at our front door to loudly rip open mail and read it. Then walk way when she's done.  
Next, i caught her stop Infront of our door to go through her phone, then to call someone and have a loud argument for a few minutes.   
I then caught her gossiping with my neighbor and choosing to fully stop walking and pause in front of our door to say this part about us ""they didn't answer the door to me isn't that weird...(neighbor was silent).. isn't that WEIRD"".. the neighbor didn't say anything and they continued to their walk. 

Then 3 hours ago, @ 11pm. i checked my camera. I caught her standing still Infront of our front door, for two minutes. It was the same time i was microwaving something and putting away left overs so i guess she stood around to hear my little bit of noise. This is the last straw for me. I'll admit. She scares the f\*ck out of me. Her still eerie demeaner had me in disbelief at first, then the two minutes mark hit and her eerie still body not moving an inch... practically had me sh\*tting my pants.. 

the fact i had someone inches away from me and just standing eerily still without my knowledge makes me nauseous even right now. I opened reddit cuz i am at my limits. I haven't spoken or seen this lady up close NOT A SINGLE TIME, and I already have a negative bias against her.. but i don't want to feed the flames of hating a mentally unwell woman, cuz its not hate really. I'm worried we got a worst case scenario on our hands, and her behavior is gonna send my mother into a fit..

The context i was talking about earlier that is important to know, is i believe she has made up a scenario in her head of fake drama she has with me. I truly believe she is mentally ill so i feel bad for her, but she has driven me to the point of anxiety, so i don't have much sympathy left to hand out. all of these incidents started happening the week after this--

The FIRST week she moved in, she messed with the AC unit too much, making it shut down. I was dead asleep at 8am, so missed her knocking on my door for help. Since i didn't answer, she called my mother for help. (mother came from her RV to reset it for her within minutes).   
Second incident was the same week, she locked her keys and cellphone in her house throwing out trash. She came knocking on my door for a while, but i was out getting breakfast with my husband and the camera didn't send me a notification. She was visibly frustrated, but walked to the apartment complex office and called my mother. (mother came within minutes to change lock completely with new sets of keys, as the tenant blamed the old door for the issues idk)

I guess my mother let her know where her daughter lives. Like randomly in a conversation, incase of serious emergencies like getting locked out. I don't know what she told her really, as I've asked my mother recently.. she thinks she just randomly said it once as she can't remember, and doesn't know why she got the impression to come over for like the ac incident.

This is the whole truth, haven't left anything out and haven't felt the need to cover anything up... yea i feel bad for not being of help when she was locked out, but i was off premises...   
  
i cannot piece together any of my own behavior that has lead to any of this. I've told my mom and showed her the videos.

I have done so much work to overcome some horrible shit that's happened to me, I was diagnosed with PTSD last year due to horrific shit out of my control. I even had doctors tell me i might live the rest of my life with the affects of what happened to me.. Despite it, I have come to a place mentally where i felt happy, grateful, and like i could live with this new dark blanket over me. I had bad panic attacks and anxiety attacks, but honestly i was so proud of the place i was in. I cannot pretend like this hasn't fully triggered me back into that space. I feel bad even, that my mother sounds so distraught when i admit im having anxiety attacks when the tenant creeps me out. She knows how detrimental the incident i went through was, and how depsite the ptsd diagnosis i was still my kind, patient, loving self. it took ahrd work to be that way. I find myself crying even now knowing i feel like this is a set back. like i dont want to have panic attacks over a woman standing at my door blair witching it up.. but honestly... im having my full episodes again and i don't know if i can handle this tenant doing this shit again.



when my mom and husband find out in the morning i stayed up all night panic attacking cuz this weirdo stood out my door last night.. they're gonna fucking lose it. but i genuinely cant even take it. i cant take their anger and distress.. im already going through too much ",MMFB,3,2,PerformerWitty9279,hell might break loose tonights incident im gon na share mother husband happened might snap theyre mothers first tenant lives couple doors respecting tenants rights top priority mine till end according mother theyre perfect tenant paper lets get point scary sht ill break experiences ill clue think mental health problem making head made drama justify behavior tenant yr old woman seems anxiety caught camera incidents creepyscary behavior scary sht thats happening camera hasnt noticed hidden corner window thank god mind long hall apartments everyone know walls thin hear everything happens infront door stop behaviors anyones door always stops infront mine first thing caught standing front door seconds ducked ground obviously checking lights next caught standing window next front door getting close trying press ear glass hear talking happened another time theres two incidents chooses stand front door loudly rip open mail read walk way shes done next caught stop infront door go phone call someone loud argument minutes caught gossiping neighbor choosing fully stop walking pause front door say part us didnt answer door isnt weirdneighbor silent isnt weird neighbor didnt say anything continued walk hours ago pm checked camera caught standing still infront front door two minutes time microwaving something putting away left overs guess stood around hear little bit noise last straw ill admit scares fck still eerie demeaner disbelief first two minutes mark hit eerie still body moving inch practically shtting pants fact someone inches away standing eerily still without knowledge makes nauseous even right opened reddit cuz limits havent spoken seen lady close single time already negative bias dont want feed flames hating mentally unwell woman cuz hate really im worried got worst case scenario hands behavior gon na send mother fit context talking earlier important know believe made scenario head fake drama truly believe mentally ill feel bad driven point anxiety dont much sympathy left hand incidents started happening week first week moved messed ac unit much making shut dead asleep missed knocking door help since didnt answer called mother help mother came rv reset within minutes second incident week locked keys cellphone house throwing trash came knocking door getting breakfast husband camera didnt send notification visibly frustrated walked apartment complex office called mother mother came within minutes change lock completely new sets keys tenant blamed old door issues idk guess mother let know daughter lives like randomly conversation incase serious emergencies like getting locked dont know told really ive asked mother recently thinks randomly said cant remember doesnt know got impression come like ac incident whole truth havent left anything havent felt need cover anything yea feel bad help locked premises piece together behavior lead ive told mom showed videos done much work overcome horrible shit thats happened diagnosed ptsd last year due horrific shit control even doctors tell might live rest life affects happened despite come place mentally felt happy grateful like could live new dark blanket bad panic attacks anxiety attacks honestly proud place pretend like hasnt fully triggered back space feel bad even mother sounds distraught admit im anxiety attacks tenant creeps knows detrimental incident went depsite ptsd diagnosis still kind patient loving self took ahrd work way find crying even knowing feel like set back like dont want panic attacks woman standing door blair witching honestly im full episodes dont know handle tenant shit mom husband find morning stayed night panic attacking cuz weirdo stood door last night theyre gon na fucking lose genuinely cant even take cant take anger distress im already going much
1fxtmnt,2024-10-07 04:42:26,Need Advice for Overcoming Anxiety and Life Skill Issues,"Hey everyone,

I hope it’s okay to share my story here. I’m really struggling and could use some support and advice. I was raised by a narcissistic mother in Bangladesh, and I’ve faced mental abuse from her my whole life. This has left me with low confidence, serious anxiety, and mild depression. Growing up, I didn’t socialize much, and because of my mother’s controlling nature, I missed out on learning basic life skills during my boyhood and teenage years.

Since moving to the UK, I’ve finally started to learn things like cooking, which felt like a huge step for me. But even simple tasks can be overwhelming. For example, tying my shoes can take me a long time, and I still struggle with basic self-care. One of the biggest challenges I face is my decision-making. I often make very poor choices. Like, if I need to go from point A to C and I know I should go through B, somehow I’ll end up taking a completely different path. It’s incredibly frustrating because I don’t always get to C, and it makes me feel lost.

I got married recently to my amazing wife, who is the love of my life, but I wasn’t mentally mature when we tied the knot. Now that we’re building a life together, I realize I have so much to learn. I have this dream of becoming a father, but my lack of self-awareness and decision-making skills makes both my wife and me hesitant. If I can’t take responsibility now, how will I manage a child?

I feel fatigued, tired, and demotivated all the time. I’ve talked to a medical professional, and I was diagnosed with low folic acid and vitamin D, which they said could contribute to my headaches and fatigue. I often suffer from migraines and sinusitis, which don’t help my mental state either. I have trouble remembering important things, crucial steps in daily tasks, and it upsets my wife. It’s tough to see how this impacts her, and I want to do better for both of us.

I also have significant anxiety when it comes to talking to new people. I avoid social situations as much as possible, and if there’s a group meeting, I find it hard to speak up even if I have questions. I bite my nails and the skin around my fingers constantly, which is another sign of my anxiety. I’ve even taken therapy sessions in the past for psychosexual issues, including struggles with fantasy, porn addiction, and masturbation.

Now that I’m in the UK and no longer under my mother’s control, I’m trying to stand on my own two feet. But I’m afraid to take jobs that require physical or technical skills—like making burgers—because I worry that I might mess up and get scolded or fired. The lack of self-confidence is paralyzing.

I’m reaching out to see if anyone has been through something similar or has advice on how to build confidence, improve decision-making, and navigate these challenges. I really need some guidance right now.

**TL;DR:** I’m struggling with anxiety, poor decision-making, and basic life skills due to a difficult upbringing with a narcissistic mother in Bangladesh.

1ffgyn1,2024-09-13 05:18:25,whats fuckin wrong with me. why cant i make any friends,"I'm a sophmore in college. I have good friends from HS but all of them are sort of scattered around at different colleges & places so chances to see them are slim, y'know. Obviously i need to make friends at my actual college but even though plenty of people seem to find me pleasant to talk to no one ever seems to care that much and I have to just chase people down for friendships like an idiot.

and it turns out the few people i did consider actual friends clearly didn't give a shit about me at all.  literally of what i considered my two best friends, one decided to drop me entirely because i made her ""uncomfortable"" once, the other basically said in too many words she'd rather not interact with me in public, ever. i just blocked her silently because attempting to work it out with her, i realized, would just end up being an argument in an attempt to keep a friend who is never going to give a shit about my feelings over. all my other friends are mutual friends w/ the two of them and they're way closer to them than they are to me, so i don't have a ton of hope in that regard. 

part of it is that i didn't do like any clubs or anything first year but even when I do it feels like such a hopeless bust. i'm deaf, so talking to like anyone is already a gigantic struggle and, like i said, no one is actually that interested in being anything more than a friendly acquaintance. perfectly capable of charming people, but they have no desire to see any more of me. 

idk what the point of this. i'm just so exhausted of being so fucking lonely. and having to chase people. my best friend from HS went to college and immediately got a boyfriend and so many friends i could barely even see her all summer because she was so busy with me. my other friend from HS seems to collect friends and even romantic interests by pure accident, without even trying (they're ace and have zero interest in romance). i'm so jealous of them it makes me want to explode. is it so much to ask that there'd be someone out there who'd actually be interested in being friends with me? and actually give a shit about me? or could the loneliness at least stop hurting?",MMFB,7,2,totally_real_tree,im sophmore college good friends hs sort scattered around different colleges places chances see slim yknow obviously need make friends actual college even though plenty people seem find pleasant talk one ever seems care much chase people friendships like idiot turns people consider actual friends clearly didnt give shit literally considered two best friends one decided drop entirely made uncomfortable basically said many words shed rather interact public ever blocked silently attempting work realized would end argument attempt keep friend never going give shit feelings friends mutual friends w two theyre way closer dont ton hope regard part didnt like clubs anything first year even feels like hopeless bust im deaf talking like anyone already gigantic struggle like said one actually interested anything friendly acquaintance perfectly capable charming people desire see idk point im exhausted fucking lonely chase people best friend hs went college immediately got boyfriend many friends could barely even see summer busy friend hs seems collect friends even romantic interests pure accident without even trying theyre ace zero interest romance im jealous makes want explode much ask thered someone whod actually interested friends actually give shit could loneliness least stop hurting

They tolerate each other but they don’t like each other.  My girl cat is a very shy cat who’s timid and prefers to hide.  She is not a fan of my male cat and will hiss and growl at him.  She also spends much of the day hiding in a closet.  In addition, she has litter box issues sometimes and will poop around my house instead of the boxes.  Doesn’t matter the litter, lid or no lid, or if it’s completely clean.  For whatever reason, she poops outside the box…sometimes. 
I moved into my new apartment todys and for the past week while I was packing and moving she’s been staying with my friend while was doing that and she became a different cat.  Out all day, social, looking for attention and being just plain CUTE!  
I’m trying to make the best decision for HER. And we are currently trying to decide if staying with my friend permanently is a better solution.  I feel like a terrible cat mom but I’m trying to make the best decision for her.  Maybe my other cat gives her too much anxiety?  maybe she just wants to be a solo cat?  Any advice or guidance would be appreciated .  My heart is breaking.

1f1zrcd,2024-08-27 02:57:06,"Promises, Deals, Coincidences and OCD. How my life changed forever since that day...","I used to make promises to God about not doing certain ocd compulsions. A non-specific punishment was being asked in case breaking the promises in order to use the fear of punishment to force myself not to do the compulsions.

One time, I explained to God that I do not mean those promises and that I am making them in order to counter my ocd. I said that a real promise would count only if I mean it, if I understand what I am promising and if I validate the promise by doing a specific gesture 3 times.

One night, ocd was telling me to do a very specific compulsion and I said some words regarding a curse and a promise about not doing that compulsion. I think I  did the validation gesture only 2 times and canceled the promise and explained to God that I did not mean it and it was because of my ocd.

That night I had some intrusive thoughts that made me think that I made other promises/deals. That really caused me depression like symptoms because I started worrying about the curse. My life changed that day and I went down the rabbit hole of ocd. What made the whole situation worse was that some coincidences started happening and I started worrying if they were really coincidences or if maybe they were signs from God to tell me about the curse.

Here are some coincidences that happened in random order:

1. I asked God as a bad sign to hear the sound of a door in the building where my aparment was. As soon as I finished my sentence, I heard someone unlocking their door. That really made me worse and I remember waking up early in the morning and the very first thought was intrusive thoughts before even opening my eyes that were kinda like "" will i hear a door now?"" etc. Some seconds later, indeed I was hearing door related sounds and that happened more than once. I remember one time, I got up from bed and checked the stairs to see if someone was leaving in order to confirm that the sound was not a dream and it was not!

* 2) I was thinking something related to my ocd and I randomly heard from tv a woman who was telling a story about a woman who asked God to turn her into stone. That reminded me my ocd issue. I started writting about it on reddit and when I was ready to write ""was it a coincidence?"" I heard that very moment my grandma saying to my father ""these are signs..."". They were talking about something unrelated but still the synchronicity worried me.
* 3) I was watching a youtube video and a guy was talking about a symbol. I got an intrusive thought that since he is talking about the symbol maybe he will also say the word ""sign"" and that will worry me. So, I decided to close the video. I also got an intrusive thought kinda like ""what if when I close the video the last word he will say is the word ""sign""? that would be worrying"". I closed the video and the last word he said was the word ""sign"". I reopened the video to confirm it.
* 4) I asked God as a bad sign to feel 5 strong twitches somewhere in my eyes and when I finished my sentence, I froze and waited anxiously to see if it will happen. I felt 1 strong twitch under my eye.
* 5) One day I was thinking stuff like ""would God make someone lose their arm in an accident if they asked it? Probably not"" and about 2 minutes later, I saw a man with one arm.
* 6) One time, I entered a chatroom that a lot of people are writting there and read something that kinda reminded me something related to my ocd issue. I closed the chatroom and got intrusive thought like ""what if i open it again and see another worrying coincidence?"" I reopened it and someone that very moment wrote the word ""Jesus""

My newest worries are these:

1. What if God/Gods do not care that I said that a promise would count only if I validate by doing a specific gesture 3 times? What if the promise got accepted as soon as I finished my sentence, even though I canceled it?
2. One night, I saw a dream in which I was in a place related to some promises. I was crying and I was on my knees. What if it was not a dream and I sleepwalked to reach a place that was located 1.5 km away from the apartment that I used to live then?

1eykchs,2024-08-22 19:42:43,Please help me find out if this was a dream or a sleepwalking episode. It is really important for me.,"I used to go to a very specific place that it is located about 1.5 km from my house. I used to be outside of a door. One time, I stopped going there because ocd gave me high anxiety about that place. I never went there and days passed.

One night, I saw in my dream that I was in that place. No memories how I got there. I was just ouside of the building. In the end of the dream, I fell on my knees anxiously. Thats all I remember. No memories of leaving the place and travelling another 1.5km. Also, I cant recall in the moment I fell on my knees, if I suddenly, opened my eyes or if there were some minutes in total darkness before waking up fully. However, there was a sense of continuity me being in my knees and then, being in bed with vivid images of that place and me falling in my knees anxiously.

What are the chances of that experience being a sleepwalking episode and not a dream? What if I sleepwalked, left my home, walked 1.5 km, reached that place with 0 memories and suddenly, my memory started working for some seconds during sleepwalking, with me being anxious and falling in my knees, and then, 0 memories of leaving that place and walking another 1.5 km to reach home and to lay in bed?

Are there any chances of this being a sleepwalking episode?


 I saw in my dream that I was suddenly, out of a building that in my dream I thought that it was a building that really exists in real life and it was about 1.5km from my old apartment.


 I remember crying and laying my head on the door and maybe kissing it and then, falling in my knees. Thats it. Suddenly, I am in my bed, waking up as if I had slept for hours and immediately considered it as a dream even though it was so vivid. However, that day I did not know that someone can sleepwalk for long distances. Also, I do not have sleepwalking history and I never imagined that it may have been a sleepwalkign episode.

Now, regarding the building, it felt as if the door and the stairs in front of the door were the only things there. it felt isolated and dark which kinda comes in contrast with what the building in real life looks.

1evyct0,2024-08-19 15:57:33,desperately seeking advice about career/current living situation,"this is going to sound so whiny, and im just really anxious at this moment so please forgive my shortsightedness. i just need some real advice.

every service i’ve tried to look at for advice has just resulted in me paying for things - therapy, coaching, medical, financial advisors, career advisors - and they never give real advice because they all want me to buy something. i can’t catch a break.



background:

i live in south africa, i’m mid-twenties, live with parents, unemployed, have an hons degree, diagnosed adhd, 35k (local currency which doesn't amount to much) in my bank account and dwindling, and started a tefl. about 1 year intern exp in architecture.



current situation:

i’m in the wrong career, and desperate to make a switch but not sure what. i don’t have time or money. every sector i’ve seen is struggling, and i’m just surrounded by people that can’t make ends meet. 



parental background and finances:

my parents are in debt and said they need me to contribute to the house. my parents are not good for my mental health - very unstable relationship, and i don’t want to live like them.

my extended family is in poverty, so my parents also function as a centre of their families, paying for everyone else when in trouble. i don’t have any financial education, and they never involved me with finances. they made really bad decisions imo but they seem to be happy with it. e.g. buying a sports car that maxed out all their credit facilities but never had a college fund. they own like 6 cars but i don’t have one, because they can’t afford it. my parents basically live for themselves and their responsibilities, and support me as a non-sustainable expense, with no capacity for me to develop my own independence. they’ve been trying to start a business for 20 years, but it never happened because of their day jobs. this weekend they sat me down and said they need to urgently figure out their futures because they can’t keep working and that i must go into business with them. 

without getting in too deep about why they’re toxic for me, all i’m going to say is that i’ve grown up thinking like them - playing it safe the wrong way, and thinking like a poor person.

my entire perspective of the world and money is completely whacked. they’re trying to push me into a job asap, but i’ve already lost 7 years doing the wrong career at their advice, and i can’t afford to do it again.



teaching tefl as an escape:

i’m currently still recovering my own health - i've exhausted my parents medical aid - i volunteer just to get out the house, but i was hoping to just escape this situation with a tefl and travel for a year to teach and be exposed to different ways of thinking. this tefl course is expiring and might need an extension, which i’ll have to pay for. from the jobs boards i’ve seen, the inflation rates make even teaching look unsustainable. the reality is, what would i honestly be able to achieve as a newbie immigrant with very little teaching experience (despite having a passion for it)? and then i’d just be struggling to make ends meet again?



my mindset and knowledge gap:

i’m just tired of thinking so small. i don’t know what career path or avenue to even look at.

every sector i’ve seen is struggling, and people barely make ends meet.

i don’t know where or how money exists in the world. 

i can’t afford any more studying - time and money wise. 

i don’t know how to fund travel to find out. 

i’ve read and wasted a lot of time reading personal development stuff - which has helped me with some things, but i still don’t even know what i don’t know about the real world, and finance and global affairs.



my entire life so far has been me desperately trying to escape my parents, but i’m having a crisis rn because with my current mindset i’m just going from the frying pan into the fire. 



i’m essentially looking for advice on these things:

1. tefl expires in a month - i might be able to finish it if i do nothing else, but this might be really unhealthy for me and i could relapse. should i spend money to extend it?
2. should i approach teaching as an escape route for short-term, or is it an actual career path that could give me financial freedom?
3. what would you do with the architecture degree?
4. what information should i even look at to figure out a way forward before the year ends?
5. how can i find a mentor that i can get real with about this?
6. any other advice is welcome tbh",MMFB,1,0,Tasty_Committee_4648,going sound whiny im really anxious moment please forgive shortsightedness need real advice every service ive tried look advice resulted paying things therapy coaching medical financial advisors career advisors never give real advice want buy something cant catch break background live south africa im midtwenties live parents unemployed hons degree diagnosed adhd k local currency doesnt amount much bank account dwindling started tefl year intern exp architecture current situation im wrong career desperate make switch sure dont time money every sector ive seen struggling im surrounded people cant make ends meet parental background finances parents debt said need contribute house parents good mental health unstable relationship dont want live like extended family poverty parents also function centre families paying everyone else trouble dont financial education never involved finances made really bad decisions imo seem happy eg buying sports car maxed credit facilities never college fund like cars dont one cant afford parents basically live responsibilities support nonsustainable expense capacity develop independence theyve trying start business years never happened day jobs weekend sat said need urgently figure futures cant keep working must go business without getting deep theyre toxic im going say ive grown thinking like playing safe wrong way thinking like poor person entire perspective world money completely whacked theyre trying push job asap ive already lost years wrong career advice cant afford teaching tefl escape im currently still recovering health ive exhausted parents medical aid volunteer get house hoping escape situation tefl travel year teach exposed different ways thinking tefl course expiring might need extension ill pay jobs boards ive seen inflation rates make even teaching look unsustainable reality would honestly able achieve newbie immigrant little teaching experience despite passion id struggling make ends meet mindset knowledge gap im tired thinking small dont know career path avenue even look every sector ive seen struggling people barely make ends meet dont know money exists world cant afford studying time money wise dont know fund travel find ive read wasted lot time reading personal development stuff helped things still dont even know dont know real world finance global affairs entire life far desperately trying escape parents im crisis rn current mindset im going frying pan fire im essentially looking advice things tefl expires month might able finish nothing else might really unhealthy could relapse spend money extend approach teaching escape route shortterm actual career path could give financial freedom would architecture degree information even look figure way forward year ends find mentor get real advice welcome tbh

I just dont gel with neurotypical people unfortunately we just never really have very many interests in common and even if we do I cant keep up with them because I have no stamina

it feels like life after the death of your last family member in the uk is basicly just hanging around by yourself waiting to die everyone is “family first” and no one will ever really care about you again...

You will never be inner circle everyone else has family or childhood friends they would rather talk to and your just shut out you cant build closeness by being there for each other because everyone I meet has a huge support network and they never talk to you about anything they just go to their existing friends and family and you dont want to confide in them because they never confide in you so you just stay an acquaintance

Theres next to no 3rd places for neurodivergent adults where I live so even meeting people I’m likely to have much in common with is really hard and unlikely especially for a woman

Therefore, and facing some embarrassment at first, I picked up the courage to seek professional support from a therapist for the first time in my life. Nonetheless, I've decided to post here in order to get additional advice from both men and women who are part of this community.

I think that my current feeling of being lost (or left behind) in life mainly stems from two circumstances: mild bullying which resulted in the inability to fully experience my teenage years if and when I compare them with the ones experienced by my peers and the loss of my father due to cancer when Covid-19 was ravaging in 2020. The first circumstance, in fact, turned me from a quite extroverted and carefree boy into an introverted, overthinking and resentful man while the second one wreaked havoc in my everyday life as I abruptly lost one of the most important people I was attached to in a phase in which everyone is supposed to settle down both personally and professionally. Cancer is basically like having to deal with a time bomb where you cannot see the timer and this puts you face to face with the precariousness of life.

Those events profoundly affected me, as I practically spent my teenage years most of the time alone focusing on my studies and these last years trying to settle down professionally facing great difficulties in both dealing with people (as I work in Sales & Distribution) and life itself. There are days in which I feel completely absorbed by what I am doing and therefore I manage to get things done as expected without having to deal with what my therapist calls ""intrusive thoughts"" and others in which I feel overwhelmed by a hurricane of negative thoughts and sensations about myself and the future ahead of me that make me cry silently on my pillow as soon as I get home at the end of the day.

I deeply regret the fact of not having been able to experience love in its blossoming, intense and raw nature during my teenage years, unlike my peers, the fact that those times and hangouts will never come back again thus leaving a deep scar inside my heart and lastly, the fact that I am very often going to be at unease in social settings when acquaintances/colleagues etc. discuss about their family, children and career prospects. At the same time I also drastically reduced the amount of time I spend on social media as people just seem to share the good things in their lives, but I always try to take any opportunity to hang around my friends and family members, even if some of them are starting a family and this makes me feel at unease as I previously explained. Going out for dinner/ a movie/ a play at the theatre all by myself is too much for me to handle and, quite frankly, humiliating at the moment. Casually going out for some drinks or travelling instead, are more manageable activities but come with some strain as well.

I'd like to become more optimistic and resilient in order not to find myself alone and hopeless as I reach maturity and retirement. What advice would you give me?

1eoc48e,2024-08-10 03:21:22,I feel like I'll end up suffocating this way. ,"Don't know exactly how to start this. My whole life I've been autistic and suffering from severe anxiety and depression and PTSD. None of these things people (not even my parents) knew until I was like 16-18. I've been able to hold it back before until I wasn't. One of the things I've learned about myself after being diagnosed and everything, is that every single little symptom gets milion times worse when I spend to much time around people. But for me even hour periodically is too much. Even after being diagnosed all triggers are being ignored by my family, but whenever my sister is depressed we HAVE to accommodate her. I love my older sister, but after like 19 years she moved back home to my room. We share it now. She's without a job and I'm on summer break from school. Because she's home all the time and in my room, I'm starting to get so depressed and overwhelmed I'm no longer able to do my summer job. I'm starting to hate her so much even though she's not doing anything wrong. Every night I'm shaking and slowly suffocating myself with silent panic attacks that I'm trying to hold back so much that my throat has been swollen and painful these days. I don't know how long I can take it. After years with struggling with mental health and getting significantly better I feel like someone trapped me without any warning in a cage and tied my neck to one of the bars. I'm going so overwhelmed im slowly going bat shit crazy. I can't sleep I feel sick after every meal and I can't tell my sister or mother about this because it'll not change anything it'll only end up adding on my mother's speech. 
My mind is slipping into dark places again out of exhaustion...
